# Execution Engines

Runtime execution for Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) and Python (Pyodide) guest code.

`crates/execution` is the native execution implementation crate. It is not the browser/native portability seam. Cross-environment contracts belong in `crates/bridge/` (`ExecutionBridge`, `HostBridge`), and browser-side execution should continue to target those shared bridge surfaces rather than depending on `crates/execution`.

When simplifying native V8 embedding, prefer concrete native types over new traits unless there is a real need for multiple interchangeable native V8 backends. Do not introduce a native-internal `V8Runtime` abstraction and then treat it like a second portability layer.

**⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS, NO FALLBACKS, NO "TEMPORARY" WORKAROUNDS:**

**ALL guest code MUST execute inside V8 isolates with kernel-backed polyfills. NEVER spawn real host Node.js processes for guest code. NEVER use `Command::new("node")` for guest execution. NEVER add a "legacy node mode", "host execution fallback", or "execution mode flag" that routes guest code through real host processes. There is exactly ONE execution path for guest JavaScript: V8 isolates managed by `crates/v8-runtime/` with polyfills that route through the kernel. Any code path where guest code reaches the real host — even as a "temporary" measure, even behind a flag, even for "compatibility" — is a critical security violation and MUST NOT be merged.**

If tests fail because they were written for the old `Command::new("node")` path, **fix or delete the tests** — do NOT restore host execution to make them pass.

## Node.js Isolation Model

**Desired state:** Guest JS/TS runs inside isolated V8 contexts managed by the execution engine. All Node.js builtins (`fs`, `net`, `child_process`, `dns`, `http`, `os`, etc.) are kernel-backed polyfills that route through the kernel VFS, socket table, and process table. Module loading is fully intercepted — guest code never touches real host APIs. The execution engine previously had this working via `@secure-exec/core` + `@secure-exec/nodejs` with full kernel-backed polyfills for all builtins.

**Current state (⚠️ STILL INCOMPLETE -- see `~/.agents/todo/node-isolation-gaps.md`):**

Guest JavaScript entrypoints in `javascript.rs` now run only through the shared V8 runtime. The remaining gaps are polyfill completeness and builtin isolation parity: some builtins still need deeper kernel-backed implementations or broader conformance coverage, but restoring a host-Node guest execution fallback is not allowed.

- Keep any real-host Node helpers isolated to clearly host-only modules used by benchmarks or import-cache tests. Guest JS/WASM/Python runtime code should depend only on neutral shared helpers (for example signal metadata or path resolution), not on files that also own host launch behavior.
- Guest-side WebAssembly inside the V8 isolate must stay enabled on both fresh isolates and snapshot restores. Real npm packages rely on `WebAssembly.Module`, `WebAssembly.Instance`, and `WebAssembly.instantiate*`, and allowing those APIs does not violate the kernel-isolation boundary because compilation stays inside the isolate. Do not reintroduce an embedder callback that blocks WASM; rely on V8's own implementation limits instead.

**Recovery reference:** The complete working polyfill + V8 isolate code from the original `@secure-exec/core` + `@secure-exec/nodejs` + `@secure-exec/v8` packages has been recovered to `~/.agents/recovery/secure-exec/`. Key files to port:
- `nodejs/src/bridge/fs.ts` (3,974 lines) -- full kernel-backed `fs`/`fs/promises` polyfill
- `nodejs/src/bridge/network.ts` (11,149 lines) -- full `net`/`dgram`/`dns` polyfill via kernel socket table
- `nodejs/src/bridge/child-process.ts` (1,058 lines) -- `child_process` polyfill via kernel process table
- `nodejs/src/bridge/process.ts` (2,251 lines) -- virtualized `process` global (env, cwd, pid, signals)
- `nodejs/src/bridge/polyfills.ts` (914 lines) -- polyfill registration and module hijacking
- `nodejs/src/bridge-handlers.ts` (6,405 lines) -- host-side bridge handlers for all kernel syscalls
- `nodejs/src/execution-driver.ts` (1,693 lines) -- V8 isolate session lifecycle + bridge setup
- `kernel/` -- the JS kernel (VFS, process table, socket table, PTY, pipes)
- `v8/` -- V8 runtime process manager, IPC binary protocol

The original source repo is at `/home/nathan/secure-exec-1/` (tagged `v0.2.1`).

**Prior art -- the original JS kernel had full polyfills:**

Before the Rust sidecar (commit `5a43882`), the JS kernel (`@secure-exec/core` + `@secure-exec/nodejs` + `packages/posix/`) had complete kernel-backed polyfills for all builtins. The pattern was:
- **Kernel socket table** -- `kernel.socketTable.create/connect/send/recv` managed all TCP/UDP. Loopback stayed in-kernel; external connections went through a `HostNetworkAdapter`.
- **Kernel VFS** -- All `fs` operations routed through the kernel VFS via syscall RPC.
- **Kernel process table** -- `child_process.spawn` routed through `kernel.spawn()`.
- **SharedArrayBuffer RPC** -- Synchronous syscalls from worker threads used `Atomics.wait` + shared memory buffers (same pattern the Pyodide VFS bridge uses today).
- **Module hijacking** -- `require('net')` returned the kernel-backed socket implementation, not real `node:net`.

The Rust sidecar kernel already has the VFS, process table, pipe manager, PTY manager, and permission system. What's missing is porting the **polyfill layer**. This is a port of proven patterns, not a greenfield design.

### Current reality vs required state

| Builtin | Required | Current | Gap |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|
| `fs` / `fs/promises` | Kernel VFS polyfill | Path-translating wrapper over real `node:fs` | Port: route through kernel VFS via RPC |
| `child_process` | Kernel process table polyfill | Path-translating wrapper over real `node:child_process` | Port: route through kernel process table |
| `net` | Kernel socket table polyfill | **No wrapper -- falls through to real `node:net`** | Port: kernel socket table polyfill |
| `dgram` | Kernel socket table polyfill | **No wrapper -- falls through to real `node:dgram`** | Port: kernel socket table polyfill |
| `dns` | Kernel DNS resolver polyfill | **No wrapper -- falls through to real `node:dns`** | Port: kernel DNS resolver polyfill |
| `http` / `https` / `http2` | Built on kernel `net` polyfill | **No wrapper -- falls through to real module** | Port: builds on `net` polyfill |
| `tls` | Kernel TLS polyfill | Guest-owned polyfill in `node_import_cache.rs` wraps the existing guest `net` transport with host TLS state | Keep client/server entrypoints on guest sockets and avoid direct host `node:tls` listeners/connections |
| `os` | Kernel-provided values | Guest-owned polyfill in `node_import_cache.rs` virtualizes hostname, CPU, memory, loopback networking, home, and user info | Keep future `os` additions aligned with VM defaults |
| `vm` | Guest-owned compatibility shim for package loading | Guest-owned compatibility builtin for `Script`, `createContext`, `isContext`, `runInNewContext`, `runInThisContext` | Keep it limited to the compatibility surface; do not fall through to host `node:vm` |
| `worker_threads` | Guest-owned compatibility shim for package loading | Guest-owned compatibility builtin exposing `isMainThread` plus inert ports; `Worker` construction stays unavailable | Keep it importable for feature detection, but never spawn real threads |
| `inspector` | Must be denied | **No wrapper -- falls through to real module** | Must stay denied |
| `v8` | Guest-owned compatibility shim for package loading | Guest-owned compatibility builtin for safe inspection/serialization helpers | Keep it limited to the compatibility surface; do not fall through to host `node:v8` |

### Loader interception (`node_import_cache.rs`)

ESM loader hooks (`loader.mjs`) and CJS `Module._load` patches (`runner.mjs`) are generated from Rust string templates. Every `import`/`require` is intercepted:
1. `resolveBuiltinAsset()` -- checks `BUILTIN_ASSETS` list. Redirects to a kernel-backed polyfill file.
2. `resolveDeniedBuiltin()` -- checks `DENIED_BUILTINS` set. Redirects to a stub that throws `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`. A builtin is in `DENIED_BUILTINS` only if it is NOT in `ALLOWED_BUILTINS`.
3. **Fall through to `nextResolve()`** -- Node.js default resolution. Returns the real host module. **This must never happen for any builtin that guest code can import.**

`AGENT_OS_ALLOWED_NODE_BUILTINS` (JSON string array env var) controls which builtins are removed from the deny list. `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_NODE_BUILTINS` in `packages/core/src/sidecar/native-kernel-proxy.ts` currently includes all builtins -- this must be reduced to only builtins that have kernel-backed polyfills.

- CommonJS `require` wrappers in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` must expose Node-compatible metadata on every per-module require function, not just on `Module.createRequire(...)`. Real packages call `delete require.cache[__filename]`, inspect `require.extensions`, and expect `require.main` to exist while running inside nested CommonJS modules.
- The builtin `buffer` module wrapper must re-export `Blob` and `File` alongside `Buffer` constants. Next.js bundles `undici` through `require("buffer")`, and missing `buffer.Blob` / `buffer.File` breaks `fetch` support even when global `Blob` / `File` exist.
- Keep the custom `events.EventEmitter` implementation function-constructible rather than a strict ES class. Legacy npm packages still use `util.inherits(..., EventEmitter)` plus `EventEmitter.call(this)`, and that pattern must stay compatible.
- Local bridge module resolution must accept `file:` specifiers by converting them back to guest paths before package/path resolution. Next.js and other ESM loaders use `import(pathToFileURL(path).href)` for config and plugin loading.

### Additional hardening layers (defense-in-depth, NOT primary isolation)

1. **`globalThis.fetch` hardening** -- Replaced with `restrictedFetch` (loopback-only on exempt ports). Does NOT cover `http.request()`, `net.connect()`, or `dgram.createSocket()`.
2. **Node.js `--permission` flag** -- OS-level backstop for filesystem and child_process only. No network restrictions. This is a safety net, not the isolation boundary.
3. **Guest env stripping** -- `NODE_OPTIONS`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` stripped before spawn.
4. **Permissioned Pyodide host launches still need `--allow-worker`.** `python.rs` bootstraps through Node's internal ESM loader worker, so the host process must keep `--allow-worker` enabled even though the guest `node:worker_threads` surface is limited to a compatibility shim and does not permit real worker creation.

## Guest `fs` and `fs/promises` Polyfill Rules

- Guest Node `fs` and `fs/promises` polyfills share the JavaScript sync-RPC transport between `node_import_cache.rs` and `crates/sidecar/src/service.rs`.
- Node-facing `readdir` results must filter `.`/`..`.
- Async methods should dispatch under `fs.promises.*`.
- `fs.promises` methods that need real concurrency must use dedicated async bridge globals in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`; wrapping `fs.*Sync` inside `async` functions still serializes `Promise.all(...)` behind the first sidecar response.
- When adding WASI guest imports in `registry/native/crates/wasi-ext`, mirror the required module/object in `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs`'s inline `NODE_WASM_RUNNER_SOURCE`; missing modules fail at `WebAssembly.instantiate()` before guest `main()` runs.
- Keep the embedded WASI shim in `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs` aligned with the patched wasi-libc surface used by the C command suite; overrides like `fcntl(F_SETFL)` now depend on `fd_fdstat_set_flags`, and missing imports fail at instantiation time before the guest command can do real work.
- The shared-V8 WASM runner now resolves its own module loads plus internal guest `fs.openSync` / `fs.readSync` / `fs.writeSync` / `fs.closeSync` traffic inside `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs`; if the embedded runner gains more internal file syscalls, extend that internal sync-RPC handling there instead of surfacing those requests to callers or reintroducing a host-Node runtime path.
- fd-based APIs (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, `fstat`) plus `createReadStream`/`createWriteStream` should ride the same bridge.
- Creation-oriented V8 `fs` helpers must preserve the guest `mode` option and resolve it against the current guest `process.umask()` before dispatching kernel-backed RPCs; dropping the `mode` field or relying on host defaults breaks Node parity for `fs.openSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`, and stream constructors that create paths.
- Guest `fs.watch` / `fs.watchFile` currently stay guest-owned polling wrappers over `fs.statSync`; keep them in `v8-bridge.source.js` unless the kernel grows a real notification API.
- Runner-internal pipe/control writes must keep snapped host `node:fs` bindings because `syncBuiltinModuleExports(...)` mutates the builtin module for guests.

## JavaScript Sync RPC

- Timeouts and slow-reader backpressure should be enforced in `javascript.rs`, not in the generated runner.
- Track the pending request ID on the host, auto-emit `ERR_AGENT_OS_NODE_SYNC_RPC_TIMEOUT` after the configured wait.
- Queue replies through a bounded async writer so slow guest reads cannot block the sidecar thread.
- Have `crates/sidecar/src/service.rs` ignore stale `sync RPC request ... is no longer pending` races after the timeout fires.
- Guest V8 timers have two host paths in `javascript.rs`: `_scheduleTimer` is an async bridge call that resolves its pending Promise later, while `kernelTimerCreate`/`kernelTimerArm`/`kernelTimerClear` are local `_loadPolyfill` dispatches that must emit `"timer"` stream events back into the V8 session so `setTimeout`/`setInterval` callbacks fire.
- In `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`, keep Node's 1ms minimum-delay clamp on `setTimeout(0)` / `setInterval(0)` separate from `setImmediate()`. If `setImmediate()` is implemented via the timeout helper, it will accidentally inherit the clamp and drift from Node ordering/parity.
- Live guest stdin also has two delivery paths: `AGENT_OS_KEEP_STDIN_OPEN` uses `"stdin"` / `"stdin_end"` stream events, while TTY-style reads use `_kernelStdinRead` and must stay forwarded to the sidecar-backed kernel fd `0` pipe so timeout and EOF remain distinguishable.
- Guest `stdin.setRawMode()` should follow the same bridge pattern as `_kernelStdinRead`: leave `_ptySetRawMode` unhandled in `LocalBridgeState`, map it to sidecar `__pty_set_raw_mode`, and have the sidecar toggle kernel PTY discipline on the guest process's fd `0` instead of keeping a local execution-only stub.
- The current V8 sync-RPC bridge effectively supports one in-flight request at a time. Do not leave long-lived network waits such as HTTP server close listeners parked on a pending sync-RPC Promise; use stream events plus short-lived follow-up RPCs so later bridge calls cannot deadlock behind the wait.

## Runner Script Assets

- Execution-host runner scripts materialized by `NodeImportCache` should live as checked-in assets under `crates/execution/assets/runners/` and be loaded via `include_str!`.
- The stdlib-backed V8 bridge bundle is generated from `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` into Cargo `OUT_DIR`; `pnpm --dir packages/core build:v8-bridge` is only for manual debugging. Keep the heavier assert/util/zlib payload in `v8-bridge-zlib.js` so the main `v8-bridge.js` stays below the 500KB cap.
- Guest `os` virtualization has two env surfaces: public `process.env` is intentionally scrubbed of `AGENT_OS_*`, while the real per-execution values live in the hidden runtime env (`globalThis.__agentOsProcessConfigEnv` in `javascript.rs`, mirrored from the sidecar's `prepare_guest_runtime_env(...)`). If `v8-bridge.source.js` needs VM-scoped CPU/memory/home metadata, read that hidden env path or `_processConfig.env` rather than the sanitized public env, and keep it aligned with `node_import_cache.rs`.
- When `build:v8-bridge` pulls deeper undici API modules (for example `undici/lib/api/*`), keep `packages/core/scripts/build-v8-bridge.mjs` aliasing any extra Node builtins they require to standalone shim files under `crates/execution/assets/undici-shims/`; those imports execute while the bundle is still bootstrapping, so they cannot depend on later `exposeCustomGlobal(...)` wiring like `_asyncHooksModule`.
- Keep `http` and `https` default agents scoped to their own module instances inside `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`; sharing a single global default agent makes `http.request()` inherit HTTPS TLS behavior. Guest-local loopback TLS upgrades must also short-circuit inside the bridge instead of calling `net.socket_upgrade_tls`, because loopback fast-path sockets never have a kernel socket id.
- Guest HTTP client readiness in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` must not treat a failed kernel `net.connect()` as request-ready just because `connecting === false`; kernel-backed sockets are only ready once `_connected === true` (or they are loopback/custom preconnected sockets), otherwise denied egress can hang in `http.request()` instead of surfacing `EACCES`.
- Keep both `ServerResponse` socket-compatibility surfaces in sync inside `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`: the main `ServerResponseBridge.socket` stub and the exported `http.ServerResponse` constructor's fake socket. If only one forwards or throws on `socket.write()`, direct `res.socket.write(...)` calls silently drop bytes on the other path.
- For guest listener-leak warnings in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`, route `EventEmitter` warnings through `process.emitWarning(...)` so `process.on("warning")` sees real warning objects, and lazily initialize `_maxListenersWarned` in helper paths because some inline bridge emitters (for example stream and child-process variants) do not always pass through the canonical constructor first.
- If you change generated builtin asset source in `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs`, bump `NODE_IMPORT_CACHE_ASSET_VERSION` in the same file or stale materialized assets under `/tmp/agent-os-node-import-cache-*` will keep serving the old code.
- The embedded WASM runner's `buildPreopens()` map must mirror `AGENT_OS_GUEST_PATH_MAPPINGS`, not just `.` / `/workspace`; otherwise kernel-visible host-dir mounts like `/etc/agentos` or `/hostmnt` can succeed through `vm.readFile()` while the same path fails under `vm.exec("cat ...")`.
- Treat `crates/bridge/bridge-contract.json` as the canonical inventory for host bridge globals and calling conventions, and treat `crates/execution/assets/polyfill-registry.json` as the canonical inventory for guest `_loadPolyfill` module names. When adding or renaming a bridge global, update those files together with `crates/v8-runtime/src/session.rs`, and when exposing a new runtime-loadable builtin, update the polyfill registry together with the `_loadPolyfill` handler in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs`.
- Guest builtin availability must stay aligned across `polyfill-registry.json`, `normalize_builtin_specifier()` in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs`, `Module.builtinModules` plus `loadBuiltinModule()` in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`, and the host-node import-cache assets in `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs`; if one surface still treats a denied builtin as unknown, guests will see `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` or host fallthrough instead of the intended `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` or compatibility stub.
- The `node:vm` compatibility shim in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` must tag sandboxes inside `vm.createContext()` and have `vm.isContext()` check only that hidden tag; treating every object-shaped value as a context breaks libraries like jsdom that probe `isContext()` before deciding whether to re-contextify.
- `node:vm` compatibility now spans three layers: the native local bridge methods in `crates/v8-runtime/src/bridge.rs`, the stdlib-backed guest module in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`, and the inline shared-runtime fallback in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs`. Keep all three aligned when changing `Script`, context isolation, or timeout semantics or sidecar builtin-conformance and execution tests will diverge.
- In `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`, `Readable.on("data")` may auto-switch to flowing mode only from the initial `readableFlowing === null` state; if guest code already called `pause()` and set `readableFlowing === false`, preserve that explicit pause until `resume()` so packages like `tar` and `node-stream-zip` do not drain early.
- The shared-runtime `node:stream` compatibility surface for sidecar/builtin-conformance tests currently comes from the inline mini-stream module in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs`, not the stdlib-backed `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` path. Stream iterator/parity fixes for guest `require("stream")` need to land in that inline module and should be covered in `crates/sidecar/tests/builtin_conformance.rs`.
- The shared-runtime `node:readline` compatibility surface exercised by sidecar/builtin-conformance tests also comes from the inline module in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs`, not only from `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`. `question()`/async-iterator fixes need to land in that inline module and should be verified in `crates/sidecar/tests/builtin_conformance.rs`.
- Bootstrap globals injected by `packages/core/scripts/build-v8-bridge.mjs` exist only to let the bundle initialize during snapshot creation. If that bootstrap layer defines `URL` or `URLSearchParams`, mark them as bootstrap stubs and have `v8-bridge.source.js` ignore or replace them once the stdlib polyfills load, or the runtime can silently keep the incomplete bootstrap implementation.
- Keep `globalThis.structuredClone` guest-owned inside `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`; falling back to the native host `structuredClone` leaks host-realm typed arrays, `Map`s, and `Date`s that fail guest `instanceof` checks even when the cloned data looks correct.
- If guest `fetch()` is powered by bundled undici, the aliased `node:stream` helpers in `crates/execution/assets/undici-shims/stream.js` must understand the bundled web-streams ponyfill too; undici's fetch path calls `finished()`, `isReadable()`, `isErrored()`, and `isDisturbed()` on `ReadableStream` response bodies, not just Node event-emitter streams.
- When testing import-cache temp-root cleanup, use a dedicated `NodeImportCache::new_in(...)` base dir so the one-time sweep stays isolated to that root.
- Active JavaScript/Python/WASM executions must hold a `NodeImportCache` cleanup guard until the child exits; otherwise dropping the engine can delete `timing-bootstrap.mjs` and related assets while the host runtime is still importing them.
- JavaScript guest validation should live in `crates/execution/tests/javascript_v8.rs`. Do not reintroduce a feature-gated host-Node guest path or a parallel host-Node compatibility suite for guest JavaScript behavior.
- Add new V8-backed JavaScript regressions to `crates/execution/tests/javascript_v8.rs` as helper functions invoked from the single top-level `javascript_v8_suite()` test, not as separate `#[test]` cases; the shared embedded runtime still trips teardown/init crashes when libtest runs those guest cases independently.
- Shared-V8 JavaScript tests should assert `uses_shared_v8_runtime()` and the absence of host guest-node launches, not `child_pid() == 0`; shared isolates still report the host runtime PID so the sidecar can manage lifecycle signals.

## Guest Path Scrubbing

- Guest path scrubbing in `node_import_cache.rs` should treat the real `HOST_CWD` as an implicit runtime-only mapping to the virtual guest cwd (for example `/root`) so entrypoint imports and stack traces stay usable without leaking the host path.
- Reserve `/unknown` for absolute host paths outside visible mappings or the internal cache roots.

## CommonJS Module Isolation

- `node_import_cache.rs` has to patch `Module._resolveFilename` and the guest-facing `Module._cache` / `require.cache` view together; wrapping only `createGuestRequire()` does not constrain local `require()` inside already-loaded `.cjs` modules.
- The V8 bridge's guest-side CommonJS helpers in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` must pass an explicit `"require"` mode into `_resolveModule`; omitting it falls back to import resolution and picks the wrong conditional export branch for dual packages.
- Keep `require.resolve()` parity between both CommonJS entrypoints in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`: `createRequire()` and the per-module `require` created in `_compile()`. If one gains `resolve.paths()` or builtin handling changes without the other, guest packages behave differently depending on how they obtained `require`.
- Eval entrypoints (`node -e` / `--eval`) must build the guest `require` from a synthetic file under the guest cwd, not from the literal `-e` token. Relative CommonJS loads in eval mode are supposed to resolve from `process.cwd()`, and using `createRequire("-e")` makes positive cases like `require('./config.json')` resolve from `"."` instead.
- Inline `node -e` / `--eval` module-mode detection in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs` must strip comments plus string/template raw text before scanning syntax markers, and positive CommonJS signals (`module.exports`, `exports.*`, `require(...)`) should win ties over ESM markers; line-prefix heuristics misclassify bundle banners and literal text.
- For builtins that guest CommonJS should `require("node:...")`, update `createRequire()` builtin guards plus both `Module.builtinModules` and `loadBuiltinModule()` in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js`; changing only one surface leaves `require()` behavior out of sync with `_requireFrom()` and can degrade into `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`, `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, or host-fallthrough mismatches.
- `crates/v8-runtime/src/execution.rs` should only fall back to runtime CJS export enumeration (`Object.keys(module.exports)`) when static extraction finds zero names; eagerly requiring every CJS module during shim generation adds avoidable work and can trigger module side effects earlier than intended.
- Inline builtin wrappers in `crates/execution/src/javascript.rs` must not call `_requireFrom()` on the same builtin subpath they implement. Subpath wrappers like `node:fs/promises` should be built from the parent builtin (`node:fs`) or a direct object, not `_requireFrom("node:fs/promises")`.
- Resolver-only coverage for `javascript.rs` should use `javascript::ModuleResolutionTestHarness` with a temp-dir fixture instead of booting a V8 isolate; mapping `/root` plus `/root/node_modules` is enough to exercise exports/imports and pnpm `.pnpm` layouts.
- `crates/execution/tests/cjs_esm_interop.rs` is the desired-behavior matrix for CJS/ESM/runtime edge cases. If an interop gap is deferred to a follow-up story, keep the strong assertion in place and mark that test `#[ignore = "US-055: ..."]` instead of weakening it to match current behavior.

## Guest `process` Hardening

- Guest-visible `process` hardening in `node_import_cache.rs` should harden properties on the real host `process` before swapping in the guest proxy.
- The proxy fallback must resolve via the proxy receiver (`Reflect.get(..., proxy)`) so accessors inherit the virtualized surface instead of the raw host object.
- Per-process filesystem state such as `umask` belongs in `ProcessContext` / `ProcessTable`. Kernel create/write entrypoints should read it there, and any guest Node exposure must be threaded through the JavaScript sync-RPC bridge instead of inheriting host `process` behavior.

## Guest `child_process` Isolation

- Strip all `AGENT_OS_*` keys from the RPC `options.env` payload in `node_import_cache.rs`.
- Carry only the Node runtime bootstrap allowlist in `options.internalBootstrapEnv`.
- Re-inject that allowlisted map only when `crates/sidecar/src/service.rs` starts a nested JavaScript runtime.
- Treat string-valued `child_process` `options.shell` values as shell-enabled in both `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` and `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs`; packages like OpenCode and `cross-spawn` pass concrete shell paths such as `"/bin/sh"`, and collapsing those to `false` makes redirected commands execute as literal program names.
- Keep sync child-process stdin wired through the bridge too: `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` `spawnSync` / `execSync` must serialize `options.input`, and the sidecar sync handlers need to write that payload to child stdin and close stdin before polling or commands like `spawnSync("/bin/cat", { input })` will diverge from host Node or hang waiting for EOF.
- Detached guest `child_process` bootstrap in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` must be driven by synchronous/immediate `child_process.poll` drains plus pre-`exit` completion, not a retry timer in `unref()`. Timer-based completion can race listener teardown and make long-lived detached daemons disappear when the parent exits.
- Guest `child_process.kill(signal)` in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` should canonicalize numeric and alias inputs through the full 1..31 POSIX table before calling the sidecar, and it should leave `child.signalCode === null` until the exit/close path runs. Node exposes the canonical signal name only after the child actually exits.
- JavaScript child-process launches in `crates/sidecar/src/execution.rs` must call `prepare_javascript_runtime_env(...)` and set `AGENT_OS_SANDBOX_ROOT` just like top-level `execute()` does. If child V8 executions miss those runtime env entries, stack traces fall back to `/unknown/...`, bare-package ESM imports like `undici` stop resolving, and spawned JS CLIs (including `pi-acp` -> `pi --mode rpc`) silently diverge from top-level behavior.
- The V8 `node:async_hooks` shim in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` must preserve `AsyncLocalStorage` state across `Promise.then`, `queueMicrotask`, `process.nextTick`, timers, and `AsyncResource.runInAsyncScope`; OpenCode's Effect instance context depends on that propagation during streamed tool execution.
- In `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs`, WASM child-process stdio can target delegate-managed guest fds rather than real host OS fds. Keep synthetic-pipe routing aligned with `delegateManagedFdWrite`/`delegateManagedFdClose`, retain those delegate fds for the child lifetime, and only release the final close after child exit; writing streamed stdout/stderr with raw host `writeSync(fd, ...)` breaks redirected shell output.
- In that same WASM host-process bridge, `child_process.poll` returning `ECHILD` after an `exit` event's trailing-drain pass is terminal, not a new fault. The sidecar can remove the child as soon as it reports exit, so post-exit drain loops must stop on `ECHILD` instead of converting a successful pipeline into `WASI_ERRNO_FAULT`.
- For sidecar-managed WASM guests, `fd_write` on fd 1 / fd 2 must go through the kernel stdio bridge (`__kernel_stdio_write`) rather than guest `process.stdout` / `process.stderr`. Falling back to the host stream inside the shared sidecar process breaks VM output isolation, bypasses PTYs and `/dev/stdout` redirection, and can make tests pass by snooping host stdout instead of the kernel-routed output path; keep any execution-only fallback scoped to non-sidecar harnesses that are not running inside a VM.
- In the standalone WASI runner path, only opt into `__kernel_stdio_write` / `__kernel_stdin_read` when the process is sidecar-managed or `AGENT_OS_WASI_STDIO_SYNC_RPC=1` is set. Helper-style Rust tests still expect bootstrap stdout/stderr to surface as queued `WasmExecutionEvent::{Stdout,Stderr}` events, so internal `fs.writeSync(1|2, ...)` sync RPCs must be translated inside `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs` instead of leaking out as raw sync-RPC traffic.
- Mirror guest-stdin fixes across both WASI host shims: `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs` and `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs` must special-case guest fd `0` before passthrough-handle delegation, or sidecar-managed stdin silently falls back to host `fs.readSync(...)` and pipe-heavy shell commands hang behind the wrong read path.
- When the standalone WASI runner still uses in-band `__AGENT_OS_WASM_SIGNAL_STATE__:` lines, parse stdout/stderr as line-oriented byte streams inside `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs` and treat the marker only when it occupies its own newline-terminated line; preserve every other byte verbatim and reassemble markers that arrive split across chunks.
- In the same WASM host-process path, synthetic pipes must initialize both `producers` and `consumers`, and consumer registration must flush any chunks buffered before the child attached. Shell builtins can write into a pipe before a spawned child like `wc` registers its stdin consumer, so registration also needs to close child stdin immediately when no writers or producers remain.
- In that synthetic-pipe path, keep pipe FD mappings alive while a registered producer or consumer is still attached, even if the guest shell closes its local duplicate of the pipe endpoint. Pipeline writers/readers outlive the shell's bookkeeping FDs, and queued bytes should treat registered consumers as active readers even after `readHandleCount` drops to zero.
- The WASM runner's read-only `path_open` guard in `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs` must allow non-mutating open flags such as `O_DIRECTORY`; only create/truncate/exclusive flags and write rights should return `EACCES`, or read-only traversal commands like `find`, `fd`, and `ls <dir>` will fail to enumerate directories.
- Keep the WASM preopen rights metadata aligned between `buildPreopens()` in `crates/execution/src/node_import_cache.rs` and the inline WASI shim in `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs`: `fd_fdstat_get` and `path_open` must read the same per-preopen `rightsBase` / `rightsInheriting` values, or read-only tiers silently regain write access through the default "all rights" fallback.
- WASM execution tests that poll `WasmExecution::poll_event_blocking()` need to handle `WasmExecutionEvent::SyncRpcRequest(_)` explicitly unless the test is asserting that control-plane behavior; the runtime includes sync RPC traffic in the same event stream as stdout/stderr/signal/exit events. `WasmExecution::wait()` only auto-services kernel stdio writes (`__kernel_stdio_write`) so simple callers still collect stdout/stderr, and it should fail fast on any other unexpected pending sync RPC instead of silently hanging.
- The host WASI runner's full-permission preopens must include both `'.'` and `'/workspace'` mapped to `process.cwd()`. Child commands that receive `cwd: "/workspace"` from the sidecar still resolve relative paths through the WASI `.` preopen, so omitting it makes `cat note.txt`/redirects fail even when the guest cwd is otherwise correct.
- In the inline WASI shim in `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs`, `path_open` must resolve the target beneath the specific descriptor's `hostPath`, not by bouncing through the global guest-path mapping table; otherwise `../` segments can escape one preopen and land in sibling mounts or host paths like `/etc/passwd`.
- WASM child-process launches should keep the guest command name in `ResolvedChildProcessExecution.process_args[0]` / WASI `argv[0]`; `execution_args` is the suffix after that command name. PATH-resolution tests for mounted commands should assert the full argv vector, not just the trailing args.
- Projected native binaries that hit the WASM path must fail with the explicit sidecar-facing code `ERR_NATIVE_BINARY_NOT_SUPPORTED` based on their magic bytes (`ELF`, `Mach-O`, `PE/COFF`) before any `WebAssembly.compile()` attempt; do not broaden regressions to accept fallback `CompileError: WebAssembly.Module()` output.

## Guest Networking Rules

- Guest Node `net` Unix-socket support follows the same split as TCP: resolve guest socket paths against `host_dir` mounts when possible, otherwise map them under the VM sandbox root on the host, keep active Unix listeners/sockets in `crates/sidecar/src/service.rs`, and mirror non-mounted listener paths into the kernel VFS so guest `fs` APIs can see the socket file.
- When proving guest `http.request()` uses the kernel socket path instead of the legacy loopback shortcut, point it at a guest `net.createServer()` that speaks raw HTTP. `http.createServer()` can still succeed through the deprecated `net.http_request` loopback dispatch, so a plain TCP listener is the reliable regression target.
- Guest `http.request()` / `http.get()` calls targeting a guest loopback `http.createServer()` must stay on the bridge's raw-socket HTTP path. Do not send `socket._loopbackServer` sockets through the undici dispatcher; the sidecar-managed loopback transport already speaks raw HTTP bytes and the undici path can hang waiting on semantics that never arrive.
- When a guest Node networking port stops using real host listeners, mirror that state in `crates/sidecar/src/service.rs` `ActiveProcess` tracking and consult it from `find_listener`/socket snapshot queries before falling back to `/proc/[pid]/net/*`; procfs only sees host-owned sockets, not sidecar-managed polyfill listeners.
- Sidecar-managed loopback `net.listen` / `dgram.bind` listeners now use guest-port to host-port translation in `crates/sidecar/src/service.rs`: preserve guest-visible loopback addresses/ports in RPC responses and socket snapshots, but use the hidden host-bound port for external host-side probes and test clients.
- V8 `node:dgram` support in `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` depends on both `loadBuiltinModule("dgram")` and `"dgram"` appearing in `Module.builtinModules`; keep those lists aligned, and keep the generated bridge payloads aligned with the current sidecar RPC contract (`createSocket` object payload, `send` bytes plus `{ address, port }`, `poll` object-or-null responses).
- Sidecar JavaScript networking policy should read internal bootstrap env like `AGENT_OS_LOOPBACK_EXEMPT_PORTS` from `VmState.metadata` / `env.*`, not `vm.guest_env`; `guest_env` is permission-filtered and may be empty even when sidecar-only policy still needs the value.
- When adding a new raw V8 bridge method used by WASM host shims, keep `crates/execution/src/wasm.rs`, `crates/execution/src/v8_runtime.rs`, `crates/v8-runtime/src/session.rs`, `crates/bridge/bridge-contract.json`, and `crates/execution/assets/v8-bridge.source.js` aligned, then rebuild `cargo build -p agent-os-v8-runtime`; otherwise the method can compile cleanly while still being unavailable at runtime.
- When the embedded V8 runtime is shared across the whole process, V8 session ids must stay globally unique and `JavascriptExecution` teardown must terminate then destroy the session; reusing ids or abruptly dropping a live session can leak state into later tests even when isolated cases pass.
- The direct embedded-runtime path should stay at the `shared_embedded_runtime()` / `EmbeddedV8SessionHandle` boundary in `crates/execution/src/v8_host.rs`; keep `crates/execution`'s local `v8_ipc::BinaryFrame` conversions at that boundary and do not reintroduce a local `UnixStream`/reader-thread transport inside the process.

## Guest `tls`

- Guest Node `tls` should stay layered on the guest `net` polyfill rather than importing host `node:tls` directly.
- Client connections must pass a preconnected guest socket into `tls.connect({ socket })`.
- Server handshakes should wrap accepted guest sockets with `new TLSSocket(..., { isServer: true })` and emit `secureConnection` from the wrapped socket's `secure` event.

## Guest `dns`

- When a newly allowed Node builtin still has bypass-capable host-owned helpers or constructors (for example `dns.Resolver` / `dns.promises.Resolver`), replace those entrypoints with guest-owned shims or explicit unsupported stubs before adding the builtin to `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_NODE_BUILTINS`; inheriting the host module is only safe for exports that cannot escape the kernel-backed port.
- When adding a Node builtin subpath such as `node:dns/promises`, keep every guest-module surface in sync: `normalize_builtin_specifier()` and `builtin_named_exports()` in `javascript.rs`, `Module.builtinModules` plus `loadBuiltinModule()` in `v8-bridge.source.js`, the import-cache builtin assets and rewrite table in `node_import_cache.rs`, and the esbuild alias shims under `crates/execution/assets/undici-shims/`.
- Socket-like compatibility shims in `v8-bridge.source.js` need both `_readableState.endEmitted` and `_readableState.ended`, and they must flip those fields together on EOF and destroy paths; packages like `ssh2`, `ssh2-sftp-client`, and `ws` inspect those internals directly instead of waiting for public stream events.
- `fs.mkdtempSync()` in `v8-bridge.source.js` should keep Node's six-character alphanumeric suffix shape while sourcing entropy from six random bytes, and it must create the directory without `recursive: true` so existing-path collisions surface as `EEXIST` instead of silently reusing a directory.

## Python Execution

- Python execution in `python.rs` should keep `poll_event()` blocked until a real guest-visible event arrives or the caller timeout expires; filtered stderr/control messages are internal noise.
- `wait(None)` should still enforce the per-run `AGENT_OS_PYTHON_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS` cap.
- `wait()` should bound accumulated stdout/stderr via the hidden `AGENT_OS_PYTHON_OUTPUT_BUFFER_MAX_BYTES` env knob rather than growing buffers without limit.
- Node heap caps from `AGENT_OS_PYTHON_MAX_OLD_SPACE_MB` need to apply to both prewarm and execution launches without leaking those control vars into guest `process.env`.
- Warmup marker fingerprints for guest assets must include mutation data (`size` plus `mtime`/`mtime_nsec`), not just inode identity; in-place rewrites of Pyodide or WASM assets can preserve the inode and still need to invalidate prewarm stamps.
- Pyodide bootstrap hardening in `node_import_cache.rs` must stay staged: `globalThis` guards can go in before `loadPyodide()`, but mutating `process` before `loadPyodide()` breaks the bundled Pyodide runtime under Node `--permission`.
- Python RPC shims in `crates/execution/assets/runners/python-runner.mjs` should translate JS bridge failures into Python-native exceptions (`PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `OSError`) instead of leaking `JsException`, and Python `subprocess.run()` should inherit the VM cwd from sidecar process state rather than Pyodide's internal `/home/pyodide` working directory.
- Treat bundled Pyodide package loading and user-configured `AGENT_OS_PYODIDE_PACKAGE_BASE_URL` as separate phases in `python-runner.mjs`: keep `loadPyodide(... packageBaseUrl)` plus the initial `pyodide.loadPackage("micropip")`/bundled preload path pinned to `/__agent_os_pyodide`, then switch `pyodide._api.config.packageBaseUrl` afterward for user `micropip.install(...)` URLs. When guest Python needs HTTP wheels, patch `pyodide.http.pyfetch` through the Python `httpRequestSync` bridge so `micropip` obeys sidecar network policy and loopback exemptions instead of bypassing them.
- Guest runtime identity defaults must stay aligned across JS, WASM, and Python: keep `HOME` bound to the kernel user's homedir, keep `PWD` bound to the execution cwd, feed those values into the Pyodide bootstrap env, and make sure Python `execute()` requests still pass through `prepare_guest_runtime_env(...)` instead of bypassing the shared runtime-env assembly.
- The shared runtime env contract also includes a stable guest `PATH` plus internal-env filtering: `prepare_guest_runtime_env(...)` should supply the canonical guest search path, `python-runner.mjs` should expose that `PATH` inside `os.environ`, and the WASM `AGENT_OS_GUEST_ENV` payload must strip internal control vars like `AGENT_OS_*` / `NODE_SYNC_RPC_*` before they reach guest-visible WASI env.
- Pyodide `micropip` support must keep guest `js` / `pyodide_js` imports blocked for user Python code while exposing only a narrow internal compat surface to `micropip` and `pyodide.http`; widening that exception re-opens host escape hatches.
- `python-runner.mjs` must suppress `loadPyodide()`/micropip progress banners such as `Loading ...` and `Loaded ...` from guest stdout; sidecar callers and tests often parse stdout as program output or JSON, so those bootstrap logs have to stay internal.
- When `python-runner.mjs` or other bundled execution assets change, bump `NODE_IMPORT_CACHE_ASSET_VERSION` in `node_import_cache.rs` if the temp materialization needs to refresh immediately; otherwise stale `/tmp/agent-os-node-import-cache-*` contents can mask the update during local test runs.
