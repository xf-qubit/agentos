//! Regression repro for "software descriptors don't actually mount commands into the VM".
//!
//! A wasm-command software package (e.g. `@secure-exec/coreutils/wasm`) must be mounted at
//! `/__secure_exec/commands/{index}/` so the sidecar's `discover_command_guest_paths` can resolve guest
//! commands. Before the fix, `AgentOs::create` sent `ConfigureVm { mounts: Vec::new() }`, so the
//! command directory was never mounted and `exec("echo hello")` failed with
//! `command not found on native sidecar path: echo hello`.
//!
//! This suite self-gates: it skips (returns early) when the sidecar binary is not built or when the
//! coreutils wasm artifacts are absent, so it stays honest in unbuilt trees. When both prerequisites
//! are present it asserts the real contract: `echo hello` exits 0 with stdout `hello`.
