/**
 * Regression guard: the default agent home dir must not hide base-image content.
 *
 * Original bug: `buildVmOptions` installed a default in-memory mount over the
 * agent home dir that shadowed base-image files. Anything the base image
 * shipped under the home dir (and, more broadly, the base filesystem the Pi SDK
 * adapter needs at startup) was hidden behind an empty, freshly-mounted volume,
 * so reads at the home dir saw an empty directory instead of base content.
 *
 * Fix: `buildVmOptions` no longer exists. VM-mount construction flows through
 * `collectSidecarMountPlan` (packages/core/src/agent-os.ts), which never injects
 * any default mount (in-memory or otherwise) at the home dir. The base
 * filesystem is the unshadowed root/lower snapshot; the home dir is created as a
 * plain directory by shadow-root bootstrap (an idempotent mkdir), and the base
 * snapshot's content is materialized into that same root afterwards -- so base
 * content under the home dir survives and is never replaced by an empty mount.
 *
 * This test reproduces the original failure condition: a default VM with NO
 * explicit mounts. If a default mount were shadowing the home dir, then:
 *   - content written under the home dir would be isolated to the shadow mount
 *     and would NOT survive into a fresh root snapshot of the base layer, and
 *   - the base image's own files would be hidden.
 * The assertions below all rely on the home dir being backed by the real,
 * unshadowed base/root filesystem.
