/**
 * NodeRuntime — ergonomic façade for running guest JavaScript end-to-end.
 *
 * Boots a fully virtualized VM (via the native sidecar) and runs guest Node
 * programs with minimal boilerplate. All of the sidecar spawn, session
 * handshake, VM creation, root filesystem bootstrap, runtime-driver mounting,
 * and lifecycle waiting are hidden behind `NodeRuntime.create()`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const rt = await NodeRuntime.create();
 * const { stdout, exitCode } = await rt.exec("console.log('hi', 1 + 1)");
 * await rt.dispose();
 * ```
 *
 * Guest code is written to an ESM module inside the VM and executed as
 * `node <file>` through the kernel, so all execution stays inside the kernel
 * isolation boundary — no host escapes, no real Node.js builtins for guest
 * work.
