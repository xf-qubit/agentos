# Kernel And Runtime Subsystem Map

This is an internal inventory of the guest-visible VM/kernel plane.

Scope:
- Includes the Rust kernel, bridge contract, native execution engines, V8 runtime daemon, native/browser sidecars, ACP session layer, and first-party mount plugins.
- Includes the first-party TypeScript mount descriptor helpers for S3 and Google Drive because they are the public entrypoints to those filesystems.
- Does not try to inventory every registry software package, agent adapter, or test file.

Many subsystems span more than one file, and some very large files contain multiple logical subsystems. The tree below is intentionally file-free so it reads as a quick system overview. The detailed file mapping starts in the sections below.
