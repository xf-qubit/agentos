# agentOS

A high-level wrapper around the Agent OS runtime that provides a clean API for running coding agents inside isolated VMs via the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP).

## Agent OS Runtime

Agent OS is a **fully virtualized operating system**. The kernel, written as a Rust sidecar, provides a complete POSIX-like environment -- virtual filesystem, process table, socket table, pipe/PTY management, and permission system. Guest code sees a self-contained OS and must never interact with the host directly. Every system call (file I/O, networking, process spawning, DNS resolution) must be mediated by the kernel. No guest operation may fall through to a real host syscall.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL guest code MUST execute inside the kernel with ZERO host escapes.** The three execution environments (WASM, Node.js/V8 isolates, Python/Pyodide) must all run within the kernel's isolation boundary. No runtime may spawn unsandboxed host processes, touch real host filesystems, open real network sockets, or call real Node.js builtins. **NEVER use `Command::new("node")` for guest execution — not even temporarily, not behind a flag.** Guest JS runs in V8 isolates (`crates/v8-runtime/`). If tests fail because they assume the old host-process model, fix or delete the tests. See `crates/execution/CLAUDE.md` for details.

- **Registry packages (software, agents, file-systems, tools)** -- see `registry/CLAUDE.md`

## Project Structure

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo + TypeScript + Biome
- **Core package**: `@rivet-dev/agent-os-core` in `packages/core/` -- contains everything (VM ops, ACP client, session management)
- **Use the renamed core package everywhere**: workspace dependencies and TypeScript subpath imports must reference `@rivet-dev/agent-os-core` (including `@rivet-dev/agent-os-core/internal/runtime-compat` and `@rivet-dev/agent-os-core/test/*`). The legacy `@rivet-dev/agent-os` name is stale and breaks pnpm workspace resolution.
- **Registry types**: `@rivet-dev/agent-os-registry-types` in `packages/registry-types/` -- shared type definitions for WASM command package descriptors. The registry software packages link to this package. When changing descriptor types, update here and rebuild the registry.
- **`crates/bridge/` is the browser/native portability seam.** Shared contracts like `ExecutionBridge` and `HostBridge` belong there. Do not treat native-only V8 embedding interfaces as cross-environment portability abstractions.
- **`crates/execution/` is the native execution implementation, not the portability layer.** Keep browser/native sharing at the `agent-os-bridge` boundary; `crates/sidecar-browser/` should not depend on `crates/execution/`.
- **npm scope**: `@rivet-dev/agent-os-*`
- **Actor integration** lives in the Rivet repo at `rivetkit-typescript/packages/rivetkit/src/agent-os/`, not as a separate package
- **The actor layer must maintain 1:1 feature parity with AgentOs.** Every public method on the `AgentOs` class (`packages/core/src/agent-os.ts`) must have a corresponding actor action in the Rivet repo's `rivetkit-typescript/packages/rivetkit/src/agent-os/`. Subscription methods are wired through actor events. Lifecycle methods are handled by the actor's onSleep/onDestroy hooks. This includes changes to method signatures, option types, return types, and configuration interfaces. **Always ask the user which Rivet repo/path to update** (e.g., `~/r-aos`, `~/r16`, etc.) before making changes there.
- **The RivetKit driver test suite must have full feature coverage of all agent-os actor actions.** Tests live in the Rivet repo's `rivetkit-typescript/packages/rivetkit/src/driver-test-suite/tests/`. When adding a new actor action, add a corresponding driver test in the same change.
- **The core quickstart (`examples/quickstart/`) and the RivetKit example (in the Rivet repo at `examples/agent-os/`) must stay in sync.** Both cover the same set of features with identical behavior, just different APIs.
- **Every quickstart must have a matching automated test landed in parallel.** When adding or changing a quickstart under `examples/quickstart/`, add or update the corresponding test in the same change so the documented path stays truthful.

## Terminology

- Call instances of the OS **"VMs"**, never "sandboxes"

## Architecture

- **The VM base filesystem artifact is derived from Alpine Linux, but runtime source should stay generic.** `packages/core/src/` must not hardcode Alpine-specific defaults. The runtime consumes `packages/core/fixtures/base-filesystem.json` as the default root layer.
- **Base filesystem rebuild flow:** `pnpm --dir packages/core snapshot:alpine-defaults` writes `alpine-defaults.json`, then `pnpm --dir packages/core build:base-filesystem` rewrites AgentOs-specific values and emits `base-filesystem.json`.
- **The default VM filesystem model should be Docker-like.** Layered overlay view with one writable upper layer on top of one or more immutable lower snapshot layers.
- **Everything runs inside the VM.** Agent processes, servers, network requests -- all spawned inside the Agent OS kernel, never on the host. This is a hard rule with no exceptions.

## Secure-Exec Reference Implementation

The Rust sidecar kernel was migrated from a working JavaScript kernel (`@secure-exec/core` + `@secure-exec/nodejs` + `@secure-exec/v8`). The original source is at `/home/nathan/secure-exec-1/` (tagged `v0.2.1`), and recovered polyfill/bridge code lives at `~/.agents/recovery/secure-exec/`. **When something doesn't work in the Rust V8 isolate runtime, check how secure-exec handled it first** — the answer is almost always already there. Key reference files:
- `nodejs/src/bridge-handlers.ts` (6,405 lines) -- host-side handlers for all kernel syscalls
- `nodejs/src/bridge/fs.ts` (3,974 lines) -- full kernel-backed `fs` polyfill
- `nodejs/src/bridge/network.ts` (11,149 lines) -- full `net`/`dgram`/`dns` polyfill
- `nodejs/src/bridge/process.ts` (2,251 lines) -- virtualized `process` global
- `nodejs/src/execution-driver.ts` (1,693 lines) -- V8 isolate session lifecycle

## V8 Polyfill and Module System Rules

- **Use `node-stdlib-browser` for pure-JS builtins, NOT hand-written stubs.** The package is already in `packages/core/package.json`. Bundle it into `v8-bridge.js` for modules like `path`, `assert`, `util`, `events`, `stream`, `buffer`, `url`, `querystring`, `string_decoder`, `punycode`, `constants`, `zlib`. Only write custom bridge-backed polyfills for kernel-backed modules (`fs`, `net`, `child_process`, `dns`, `http`, `os`, `crypto`). This is how secure-exec did it. Hand-written stubs are incomplete and break real packages.
- **Use undici for fetch(), not a high-level bridge call.** Guest `fetch()` must use undici running inside the V8 isolate, making TCP connections through the kernel socket table (`net.connect` bridge). Do NOT use `_networkFetchRaw` which bypasses the kernel network stack, permissions, and DNS. The fetch path must be: `undici → net.connect → kernel socket table → host network adapter`. This matches how real Node.js works.
- **Every Node.js builtin module must be a COMPLETE implementation, not a stub.** If `require('path')` is supported, it must have ALL standard methods (normalize, resolve, relative, join, dirname, basename, extname, isAbsolute, sep, delimiter, parse, format). A module that only implements `join` and `resolve` is a stub — stubs cause silent failures in real packages. If you can't implement a method fully, throw `ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` — never return undefined or silently skip.
- **CJS export extraction must handle dynamic patterns.** The ESM wrapper for CJS modules extracts named exports via `extract_cjs_export_names()`. This MUST handle: `exports.X = ...`, `Object.defineProperty(exports, ...)`, `Object.assign(module.exports, ...)`, and spread syntax. If static extraction fails, fall back to runtime extraction (evaluate module, enumerate `Object.keys(module.exports)`). Incomplete extraction causes missing named imports that silently break downstream packages.
- **CJS/ESM interop must never hang.** If `require()` is called on an ESM-only package, throw `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` immediately — never recurse infinitely or hang. If `import()` is called on a CJS package, wrap it in an ESM shim. Test both directions.
- **Circular dependencies must terminate.** The module cache must prevent re-evaluation. Test with A→B→A and A→B→C→A chains.
- **Every polyfill addition needs a conformance test.** When adding a new builtin method or module, add a test that verifies the return value matches real Node.js behavior. Tests go in `crates/execution/tests/` or `crates/sidecar/tests/`.

## npm Package Compatibility

- **npm packages must work UNMODIFIED inside the VM.** The V8 module resolver must load published npm packages from `node_modules/` as-is — no esbuild, no bundling, no transpilation, no preprocessing. If `require('some-package')` or `import 'some-package'` doesn't work, fix the module resolver or polyfills, don't add a build step to transform the package. The goal is: `npm install` a package on the host, mount `node_modules/` into the VM, and it just works.
- **Agent SDKs must run unmodified.** Pi SDK (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`), Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`), and any other agent SDK must load and execute inside V8 without modification. Our custom ACP adapters (`registry/agent/*/`) are thin wrappers that import the SDK — the SDK itself is never patched or bundled.

## Agent Adapters

- **Agent adapters MUST use the real agent SDK.** Each agent adapter (`registry/agent/*/src/adapter.ts`) must call the agent's SDK directly (e.g., `createAgentSession()` from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`). **NEVER replace an SDK adapter with a minimal/stub adapter that makes direct API calls** (e.g., direct `fetch` to `/v1/messages`). If the SDK doesn't work in V8, fix the V8 compatibility — don't bypass the SDK.
- **No host agent exceptions.** Host-native wrappers and host binary launch paths are not allowed.
- **Claude patched SDK/CLI artifacts are discovered via dist manifests.** `registry/agent/claude/scripts/build-patched-cli.mjs` writes `dist/claude-cli-patched.json` and `dist/claude-sdk-patched.json`; the adapter resolves those manifests first and only falls back to the upstream SDK files when they are missing. Update the build script/manifests rather than hardcoding hashed artifact paths in the adapter.

## VM System Tools

- **The VM has a full POSIX toolchain.** WASM-compiled coreutils, `sh`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `find`, `tar`, `git`, and 100+ other commands are available via registry software packages (`registry/software/`, compiled from `registry/native/crates/commands/`). Agent code running inside the VM can spawn these tools via `child_process`. **Do not assume system tools are missing** — if a command isn't resolving, debug the command resolution path in the sidecar, don't work around it.

## Dependencies

- **Rivet repo** -- A modifiable copy lives at `~/r-aos`. Use this when you need to make changes to the Rivet codebase.
- Mount host `node_modules` read-only for agent packages (pi-acp, etc.)

## Documentation

- **Keep docs in `~/r-aos/docs/docs/agent-os/` up to date** when public API methods or types are added, removed, or changed on AgentOs or Session classes.
- **Keep the standalone `secure-exec` docs repo up to date** when exported API methods, types, or package-level behavior change for public `secure-exec` compatibility packages. The source of truth is the repo that contains `docs/docs.json`.
- **The active public `secure-exec` package scope is currently `secure-exec` and `@secure-exec/typescript`.** Do not assume other legacy `@secure-exec/*` packages are still part of the maintained public surface unless the user explicitly says so.
- **If a user asks for a `secure-exec` change without naming the package, prompt them to choose the target public package when it is ambiguous.**
- **Keep `website/src/data/registry.ts` up to date.** When adding, removing, or renaming a package, update this file so the website reflects the current set of available apps.
- **No implementation details in user-facing docs.** Never mention WebAssembly, WASM, V8 isolates, Pyodide, or SQLite VFS in documentation outside of `architecture.mdx`. Use user-facing language instead.
- If you need to look at the documentation for a package, visit `https://docs.rs/{package-name}`. For example, serde docs live at `https://docs.rs/serde/`.

## Agent Working Directory

All agent working files live user-scoped in `~/.agents/`, never inside the repo. Override the location with the `AGENTS_DIR` env var. These files are not committed; `.agent/` is gitignored as a safety net.

- **Specs**: `~/.agents/specs/` -- design specs and interface definitions for planned work.
- **Research**: `~/.agents/research/` -- research documents on external systems, prior art, and design analysis.
- **Todo**: `~/.agents/todo/*.md` -- deferred work items with context on what needs to be done and why.
- **Notes**: `~/.agents/notes/` -- general notes and tracking.

When the user asks to track something in a note, store it in `~/.agents/notes/` by default. When something is identified as "do later", add it to `~/.agents/todo/`. Design documents and interface specs go in `~/.agents/specs/`.

## CLAUDE.md Convention

- Every directory that has a `CLAUDE.md` must also have an `AGENTS.md` symlink pointing to it (`ln -s CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md`). This ensures other AI agents that look for `AGENTS.md` find the same instructions.
- When adding entries to any `CLAUDE.md`, keep them concise -- ideally a single bullet point. Do not write paragraphs.
- Only add design constraints, invariants, and non-obvious rules that shape how new code should be written. Do not add general trivia, current implementation wiring, module organization, API signatures, or ephemeral migration state. Anything a reader can learn from the code belongs in module doc-comments or reference docs.

## Naming + Data Conventions

- Data structures often include:
  - `id` (uuid)
  - `name` (machine-readable name, must be valid DNS subdomain, convention is using kebab case)
  - `description` (human-readable, if applicable)
- Use UUID (v4) for generating unique identifiers.
- Store dates as i64 epoch timestamps in milliseconds for precise time tracking.
- Timestamps use `*_at` naming with past-tense verbs. For example, `created_at`, `destroyed_at`.

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in neighboring files.
- Always check existing imports and dependencies before adding new ones.
- **Always add imports at the top of the file instead of inline within a function.**
- Never use a `_ =>` fall-through arm when matching on a Rust enum or a TypeScript discriminated union. Enumerate every variant so adding a new one later is a compile error, not a silent behavior change. `_` is fine for `Result`, `Option`, integers, strings, and other open value spaces. `_ => unreachable!()` / `_ => panic!()` are explicit asserts and acceptable.

### Comments

- Write comments as normal, complete sentences. Avoid fragmented structures with parentheticals and dashes (hyphens are OK).
- Do not use em dashes. Use periods to separate sentences instead.
- Documenting deltas is not useful. A developer who never saw the previous code gains nothing from a comment saying something was removed or changed. The only reason to note something missing is if its absence is unintuitive.

## Logging

- Use tracing in Rust. Never use `eprintln!` or `println!` for logging. Always use `tracing::info!`, `tracing::warn!`, `tracing::error!`, etc.
- Do not format parameters into the main message. Use structured fields: `tracing::info!(?x, "foo")` instead of `tracing::info!("foo {x}")`.
- Log messages should be lowercase unless mentioning specific code symbols.

## Error Handling

- Always return anyhow errors from failable Rust functions. Do not glob-import from anyhow. Prefer `.context()` over the `anyhow!` macro.

## Fail-By-Default Runtime

- Avoid silent no-ops for required runtime behavior. If a capability is required, validate it and throw an explicit error with actionable context instead of returning early.
- Do not use optional chaining for required lifecycle and bridge operations. Optional chaining is acceptable only for best-effort diagnostics and cleanup paths (logging hooks, dispose/release cleanup).

## Async Rust Locks

- Async Rust code defaults to `tokio::sync::Mutex` / `tokio::sync::RwLock`. Do not use `std::sync::Mutex` / `std::sync::RwLock`.
- Use `parking_lot::Mutex` / `parking_lot::RwLock` only when sync is mandated by the call context: `Drop`, sync traits, FFI callbacks, or sync `&self` accessors.
- If an external dependency's struct requires `std::sync::Mutex`, keep it at the construction boundary with an explicit forced-std-sync comment.
- Prefer async locks because sync guards can be silently held across `.await`, and poisoning creates `.expect("lock poisoned")` boilerplate.

## Performance

- Never use `Mutex<HashMap<...>>` or `RwLock<HashMap<...>>`. Use `scc::HashMap` (preferred), `moka::Cache` (for TTL/bounded), or `DashMap` for concurrent maps. Use `scc::HashSet` instead of `Mutex<HashSet<...>>`.
- Hold lock guards as briefly as possible. Clone/copy needed data and `drop(...)` before async work.
- Never poll a shared-state counter with `loop { if ready; sleep(Nms).await; }`. Pair the counter with a `tokio::sync::Notify` (or `watch::channel`) that every decrement-to-zero site pings, and wait on that instead.
- Reserve `tokio::time::sleep` for per-call timeouts, retry/reconnect backoff, deliberate debounce windows, or `sleep_until(deadline)` arms in an event-select loop. A `loop { check; sleep }` body is polling and should be event-driven instead.
- `scc` async methods do not hold locks across `.await` points. Use `entry_async` for atomic read-then-write.
- Never add unexplained wall-clock defers like `sleep(1ms)` to decouple a spawn from its caller. Use `tokio::task::yield_now().await` or rely on the spawn itself.

## Memory Leaks

- Do not introduce intentional leaks (`Box::leak`, `std::mem::forget`, `*_into_raw` without matching cleanup) unless an upstream API makes ownership impossible to express safely.
- Never call `Box::leak` inside a per-request, per-error, or per-call code path. If a `'static` reference is required, use a compile-time `static`/`const` or intern it through a process-global map keyed by identity.
- Interned leaks must be bounded by unique schema/config identity and must not include unbounded user input such as raw error messages, request paths, or headers.
- `std::mem::forget` is only acceptable when an FFI handle cannot be dropped in the current context; document the constraint inline, prove the leak is bounded, and prefer routing cleanup through an Env-bearing owner.
- Spawned futures that capture JS callbacks or other heavy resources must have a guaranteed completion path (e.g. a `CancellationToken` whose clones are guaranteed to drop). A `spawn_local(async move { token.cancelled().await; ... })` only drains if every clone of the token is dropped or cancelled.

## Testing

- **Never use `vi.mock`, `jest.mock`, or module-level mocking.** Write tests against real infrastructure (real kernel, real filesystems, real processes). For LLM calls, use `@copilotkit/llmock` to run a mock LLM server. For protocol-level test doubles (e.g., ACP adapters), write hand-written scripts that run as real processes. `vi.fn()` for simple callback tracking is acceptable.
- **Never paper over flakes with retry loops or bumped waits.** When a test flakes, root-cause the race, write a deterministic repro, fix the underlying ordering, and delete any flake-workaround note.
- **Rust tests live under `tests/`, not inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `src/`.** Exceptions must be justified (e.g., testing a private internal that can't be reached from an integration test).

## Version control (jj)

- This repo uses jj (Jujutsu) on top of git. **jj's workflow is inverted from git:** the working copy is itself a revision that auto-tracks edits, so you create a new revision *before* making changes (with `jj new`) rather than committing *after* (`git commit`). The description is set separately via `jj describe`. There is no staging step.
- Before making changes, check whether jj is initialized by running `jj status`. If it fails (e.g. "There is no jj repo in '.'"), run `jj git init --colocate` from the repo root so jj lives alongside the existing `.git` directory. Do NOT run `jj git init` without `--colocate` — that creates a standalone jj repo and breaks the git workflow.
- **MUST run `jj new` before making any file edits for a new task.** This is the first step of any task that touches files. Run it before reading, before planning, before editing. The only exception is when you are directly fixing or finishing the change at `@` that you just made in this same session. In that case use `jj squash --into <rev>` or `jj edit <rev>`. If you already started editing without running `jj new`, stop and split the changes with `JJ_EDITOR=true jj split <paths>` before continuing. Each revision must be one self-contained change reviewable on its own. Never mix unrelated work into one revision.
- Set the revision description with `jj describe -m "[SLOP({full-model-id}-{reasoning})] {conventional commit message}"`. Use conventional commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.) with a single-line message. `{full-model-id}` is the canonical model ID (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`). `{reasoning}` is the reasoning effort (`high`, `medium`, `low`, `off`) — include it only if the runtime exposes it; otherwise omit the `-{reasoning}` suffix entirely.
- Examples: `[SLOP(claude-opus-4-7-high)] feat(metrics): record depot sqlite phase timings` or, when reasoning is not known, `[SLOP(claude-opus-4-7)] fix(pegboard): handle empty ack batch`.
- **Never add a co-author trailer** (no `Co-Authored-By: ...` line). Descriptions are single-line only.
- **Never push to `main` unless explicitly specified by the user.**
- **Safety:** Never run destructive jj or git commands (`jj git push`, `jj abandon`, `jj squash` into a non-current revision, `jj op restore`, `jj op undo` past your own work, `jj rebase -d main`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`) unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Build & Dev

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build        # turbo run build
pnpm test         # turbo run test
pnpm check-types  # turbo run check-types
pnpm lint         # biome check
```

- **Always run tests and agent-os-heavy commands through `just test-bounded '<command>'`** so the whole process tree is constrained by systemd. This keeps test runners, sidecars, agent sessions, builds, and their subprocesses from overwhelming the host by capping them to 60% of logical CPUs and 60% of currently available memory with lower CPU/IO priority. Use `just test-bounded` for the default `pnpm test`, or pass an explicit shell string such as `just test-bounded 'pnpm --dir packages/core exec vitest run tests/pi-sdk-adapter.test.ts'`.
- CI and release automation must install the pnpm workspace with `--frozen-lockfile` before Cargo builds that generate V8 bridge assets into `OUT_DIR`. Fork pull requests should run the same `pnpm test` command without `AGENTOS_E2E_NETWORK=1`.
- When changing V8 bridge registration or snapshot bootstrap code under `crates/v8-runtime/`, rebuild `agent-os-v8-runtime` before rerunning sidecar V8 integration tests. `cargo test -p agent-os-sidecar` can otherwise reuse stale embedded-runtime objects from `target/`.
- The `crates/v8-runtime` snapshot test (`snapshot::tests::snapshot_consolidated_tests`) currently has to run in isolation: use `cargo test -p agent-os-v8-runtime -- --test-threads=1` for the main suite and `cargo test -p agent-os-v8-runtime snapshot::tests::snapshot_consolidated_tests -- --exact --ignored` separately until the shared test binary teardown SIGSEGV is fixed.
