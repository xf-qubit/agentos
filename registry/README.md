# secure-exec Registry

Software packages for secure-exec VMs: WASM command binaries
(`registry/software/*`), JavaScript agent adapters (`registry/agent/*`), and
tool packages (`registry/tool/*`). Everything under the `@agentos-software/*`
npm scope.

## Consuming packages

```bash
npm install @agentos-software/coreutils @agentos-software/grep
# or a meta-package for a complete set:
npm install @agentos-software/common
```

Each package default-exports a descriptor whose `packageDir` points at the
self-contained runtime dir the sidecar projects under
`/opt/agentos/<name>/<version>` (meta-packages export an array of descriptors):

```typescript
import coreutils from "@agentos-software/coreutils";
import grep from "@agentos-software/grep";

export const software = [coreutils, grep];
```

## Package anatomy

```
registry/software/<pkg>/
├── package.json           name, per-package semver version, build script
├── agentos-package.json   manifest: runtime fields (name/agent/provides) +
│                          staging fields (commands/aliases/stubs)
├── src/index.ts           descriptor: packageDir -> ./package/ (dist/package)
├── bin/                   staged command binaries (generated build output)
└── dist/package/          the assembled runtime dir (shipped in the npm tarball):
    ├── package.json       { name, version, bin: { <cmd>: "bin/<cmd>" } }
    ├── agentos-package.json
    └── bin/<cmd>          the binaries, copied verbatim
```

The whole lifecycle is owned by **`@rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain`**
(`packages/agentos-toolchain`) — the same CLI 3rd-party repos use to build and
publish their own agentOS packages (`npx @rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain`):

- `stage --commands-dir <dir>` — populate `bin/` from a compiled commands
  directory, per the `commands` / `aliases` / `stubs` lists in
  `agentos-package.json`.
- `build` — assemble the clean `dist/package/` runtime dir from `bin/`.
- `pack` — build a self-contained node-closure package (JS agents).
- `publish` — publish to npm; dist-tag `dev` by default, `latest` only with an
  explicit `--latest`.

## Building

All recipes run from the repo root (see `justfile`):

```bash
just registry-native            # compile the fast native wasm command gate
just registry-native-cmd <name> # build ONE command binary, whatever its toolchain
just registry-build             # stage + assemble every registry package
pnpm --filter @agentos-software/coreutils build:runtime # assemble runnable coreutils
just registry-status            # per-package state; --remote adds npm dist-tags
just registry-test              # registry integration tests (registry/tests)
```

### Building coreutils from a clean checkout

`registry/software/coreutils/bin/` is deliberately gitignored and must never be
committed. A fresh checkout has no runnable coreutils package: VMs, browser
demos, and tests that use `sh`, `cat`, `chmod`, or the other bundled commands
will not work until the native WASM commands are compiled and staged.

Run the complete build from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
just registry-native
pnpm --filter @agentos-software/coreutils build:runtime
```

The native build compiles the patched Rust and C WASI sources into
`registry/native/target/wasm32-wasip1/release/commands/`. `build:runtime`
strictly stages every command, alias, and stub into
`registry/software/coreutils/bin/`, then assembles `dist/package/`. It fails if
the native command set is absent or incomplete; an empty placeholder is not a
usable coreutils package.

The ordinary `build` script retains `--if-missing skip` so repository-wide
TypeScript builds can run without first compiling the WASM toolchain. On a
source-only checkout that script assembles an empty placeholder. It does not
make `sh` or any coreutils command available and is not a runtime build.
Publishing coreutils runs `build:runtime` through its `prepublishOnly` lifecycle
and fails rather than publishing an empty or incomplete command package.

`just registry-native-cmd sh` is useful when iterating on only the shell, but it
does not build the other commands and therefore is not enough to assemble
coreutils. Use the complete sequence above for demos, packaging, and E2E tests.

`registry-native-cmd` (= `make -C registry/native cmd/<name>`) is the uniform
per-binary entry point; it dispatches to whichever toolchain owns the command:

| kind | commands | what it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | any `crates/commands/<name>` (sh, ls, rg, …) | `cargo build -p cmd-<name>` (build-std) + `wasm-opt` |
| C | `zip unzip envsubst sqlite3 curl wget duckdb` | `make -C c sysroot build/<src>` + per-command install |
| codex | `codex`, `codex-exec` | the codex fork build (needs the fork checkout) |
| C | `vim` (pinned upstream clone + bridge in `c/vim/`) | `make -C c sysroot build/vim` + install |
| external | `vix` | validates the hand-built binary is in the drop zone; errors with instructions otherwise |

The default native build (`registry/native`) compiles the fast command gate to
`wasm32-wasip1` with a patched std (`-Z build-std`, `patches/`), runs
`wasm-opt -O3`, and drops the binaries in
`registry/native/target/wasm32-wasip1/release/commands/`. The bulk gate
intentionally excludes slow/heavy or non-default commands: `git`, `duckdb`,
`vim`, `wget`, and the external `codex`/`codex-exec` fork build. Build those explicitly with
`just registry-native-cmd <name>` when working on them. Package builds then run
`agentos-toolchain stage`, followed by `tsc` and `agentos-toolchain build`.
Use coreutils `build:runtime` for strict staging as described above; software
packages may use skip mode for source-only checks or commands outside the
default native gate.

Within this repo, everything consumes the LOCAL builds by default: the registry
packages are pnpm workspace members, so tests and examples resolve them via
`workspace:*` — no publish needed for local development.

Exceptions:
- `software/codex/wasm/` is the install target of the codex fork's build
  (`make -C registry/native codex`); `software/codex-cli` stages from it.
- C-built commands (sqlite3, zip, unzip, curl, wget, duckdb) need the patched
  sysroot; `just registry-native-cmd <name>` builds it on demand. Without it
  those packages stay empty placeholders.
- `vim` builds from source: `just registry-native-cmd vim` clones the pinned
  vim tag and compiles it against the patched sysroot + the termios/termcap
  bridge in `registry/native/c/vim/` (its runtime tree is staged by the
  package `scripts/stage-runtime.mjs` and applied via manifest `provides`).
- `vix` is the one remaining external drop-zone binary (no source pipeline):
  place the hand-built wasm at `registry/native/target/.../commands/vix`.

## Publishing

Packages **version independently** (per-package semver in each
`package.json`). Publishing NEVER moves the `latest` dist-tag unless asked:

```bash
just registry-publish coreutils            # publish @agentos-software/coreutils under dist-tag `dev`
just registry-publish coreutils my-branch  # ... under a custom tag
just registry-publish coreutils latest     # DELIBERATE release: moves `latest`
just registry-publish-all                  # every built software package, dist-tag `dev`
```

Bump the package's `version` in its `package.json` (commit it) before
publishing. CI does not publish these packages (the publish workflow's package
discovery skips `@agentos-software/*` except the manifest); the agent packages
under `registry/agent/*` preview-publish via `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`
under a branch dist-tag.

agent-os consumes the published packages pinned per-package in its catalog
(`just agentos-pkgs-status` there), and flips to these local checkouts with
`just agentos-pkgs-local`.
