# Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks comparing agentOS to traditional sandbox providers.

These are the benchmark figures shown on the agentOS marketing page. All numbers are computed from the same data source used by the marketing page. For independent sandbox comparison data, see the [ComputeSDK benchmarks](https://www.computesdk.com/benchmarks/).

## Cold start

Time from requesting an execution to first code running. Measured using the sleep workload (a minimal VM running an idle Node.js process). Sandbox baseline: **E2B**, the fastest mainstream sandbox provider as of March 30, 2026. See [ComputeSDK benchmarks](https://www.computesdk.com/benchmarks/) for independent sandbox comparison data.

| Metric | agentOS | Fastest sandbox (E2B) |
|---|--:|--:|
| Cold start p50 | 4.8 ms | 440 ms |
| Cold start p95 | 5.6 ms | 950 ms |
| Cold start p99 | 6.1 ms | 3,150 ms |

## Memory per instance

Measured via staircase benchmarking:

1. **Warmup.** A throwaway VM is created, started, and destroyed before measurement begins. This pays one-time costs (module cache, JIT compilation) that are amortized away in any real deployment where the host process is long-lived.
2. **Baseline.** GC is forced twice (`--expose-gc`), then RSS is sampled across the entire process tree by reading `/proc/[pid]/statm` for the host process and all descendants. This captures child processes (e.g. V8 isolates running as separate processes) that `process.memoryUsage().rss` would miss.
3. **Staircase.** VMs are added one at a time. After each VM starts and settles, GC is forced and RSS is sampled again. The delta from the previous sample is the incremental cost of that VM.
4. **Average.** The per-VM cost is the mean of all step deltas.
5. **Teardown.** All VMs are disposed and the reclaimed RSS is recorded.

RSS is a process-wide metric that includes thread stacks and OS-mapped pages beyond the VM itself, so the reported figure is an upper bound on the true per-VM cost.

Sandbox baseline: **Daytona**, the cheapest mainstream sandbox provider as of March 30, 2026. Default sandbox: 1 vCPU + 1 GiB RAM.

### Full coding agent

Pi coding agent session with MCP servers and mounted file systems.

| Metric | agentOS | Cheapest sandbox (Daytona) |
|---|--:|--:|
| Memory per instance | ~131 MB | ~1024 MB |

### Simple shell command

Minimal shell workload running simple commands.

| Metric | agentOS | Cheapest sandbox (Daytona) |
|---|--:|--:|
| Memory per instance | ~22 MB | ~1024 MB |

## Cost per execution-second

Assumes one agent per sandbox (needed for isolation) and 70% host utilization for self-hosted hardware (the industry-standard HPA scaling threshold). Cost formula: `server cost per second / concurrent executions per server`, where concurrent executions = `floor(server RAM / agent memory) × 0.7`.

Sandbox baseline: **Daytona** at $0.0504/vCPU-h + $0.0162/GiB-h with a 1 vCPU + 1 GiB minimum. Source: [daytona.io/pricing](https://www.daytona.io/pricing).

## Reproducing

agentOS benchmarks live in the [agent-os repository](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos) under `scripts/benchmarks/`.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (see `.nvmrc`) and `pnpm`, with dependencies installed: `pnpm install`
- A Rust toolchain (`cargo`) — the benchmarks build and run the native release sidecar
- A reasonably **idle machine**: cold-start latency tails are sensitive to background CPU and GC jitter

### Run everything

From the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh
```

The script builds the TypeScript packages and an **optimized (release) sidecar**, points the SDK at it via `AGENT_OS_SIDECAR_BIN`, and writes one JSON result per benchmark to `scripts/benchmarks/results/`:

| Result file | Feeds marketing input |
|---|---|
| `coldstart-sleep.json` | `COLDSTART_P50/P95/P99_MS` |
| `memory-sleep.json` | `MEMORY_SHELL_MB` (`result.avgPerVmRssBytes / 1024²`) |
| `memory-pi-session.json` | `MEMORY_AGENT_MB` (`result.avgPerVmRssBytes / 1024²`) |

Copy those numbers into `website/src/data/bench.ts`; every figure and multiplier on this page recomputes from them.

### Run a single benchmark

Each benchmark is a standalone `tsx` entrypoint. Build first (`pnpm build` and `cargo build --release -p agent-os-sidecar`), then:

```sh
export AGENT_OS_SIDECAR_BIN="$PWD/target/release/agent-os-sidecar"

# Cold start (sleep workload)
pnpm exec tsx scripts/benchmarks/coldstart.bench.ts --workload=sleep --iterations=2000

# Memory — simple shell command
pnpm exec tsx --expose-gc scripts/benchmarks/memory.bench.ts --workload=sleep --count=20

# Memory — full coding agent
pnpm exec tsx --expose-gc scripts/benchmarks/memory.bench.ts --workload=pi-session --count=10
```

JSON goes to stdout; a human-readable table and progress go to stderr.

### Sample sizes

Percentiles are nearest-rank: `sorted[ceil(p/100 · n) − 1]`. With too few samples the tail is meaningless — at `n = 30`, **p99 is literally the single slowest run** and p95 is the second slowest. Use enough iterations that the reported percentile is averaged over real tail samples, not one outlier:

| Statistic | Minimum iterations |
|---|--:|
| p50 (median) | ~30 |
| p95 | ~200 |
| p99 | ~1,000 |

`run-benchmarks.sh` uses `--iterations=2000` for cold start so p95/p99 are trustworthy. Memory per VM is a mean of per-VM step deltas with low variance, so `--count=20` (shell) / `--count=10` (agent) is sufficient.

> The `pi-session` memory workload needs a working in-VM agent runtime (the Pi adapter process must launch inside the VM). On builds where the agent runtime is unavailable it will fail its process check rather than report a number.

### Methodology

Every benchmark **creates the sidecar once up front** (`AgentOs.createSidecar()`) and leases all VMs from it. VMs are **incremental tenants of one shared sidecar process** — not one process each — so the figures measure the marginal cost of a VM, not a fresh process. (`AgentOs.create()` with no `sidecar` option already uses the shared `default`-pool sidecar, so this is the default everywhere, including RivetKit actors.)

Before any measured iteration, each benchmark does a **cold run** — a throwaway VM that is created, started, and (for cold start) snapshotted. This pays the one-time process spawn + bootstrap so the recorded numbers reflect the warm, steady-state incremental per-VM cost, never the first VM. The release sidecar is required: a debug build is several times slower and inflates the numbers.
