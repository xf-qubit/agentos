# Publishing Packages

Build, publish, and consume agentOS packages — locally, from npm, or from your own repo.

agentOS packages — WASM command sets and packed JS agents alike — go through one lifecycle, owned by the **`@rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain`** CLI. This page covers the full flow: building a package, publishing it to npm, and wiring a consumer at either a published version or a local checkout.

## The lifecycle

Every package is an npm package whose default export points at a self-contained runtime dir (`dist/package/`) that the sidecar projects under `/opt/agentos/<name>/<version>`. The toolchain provides four subcommands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `stage --commands-dir <dir>` | Populate `bin/` from a directory of compiled binaries, per the `commands` / `aliases` / `stubs` lists in the package's `agentos-package.json`. |
| `build` | Assemble `dist/package/` from `bin/` (+ optional `share/`) and pack it into `dist/package.aospkg` — the runtime artifact with the embedded manifest (the `agentos-package.json` is pack-time input, not shipped). |
| `pack` | Build a self-contained node-closure package from an npm package or local dir (JS agents; validates headers, rejects native addons). |
| `publish` | Publish the built package to npm. Dist-tag is **`dev` by default**; the `latest` pointer only moves with an explicit `--latest`. |

## Building

In the AgentOS registry, the `just` recipes drive the toolchain (see [Building Binaries](/docs/custom-software/building-wasm)):

```bash
just toolchain-build            # compile the native wasm binaries (once per checkout)
just software-build             # stage + assemble every software package
just software-build coreutils   # ... or one package
```

## Publishing

Registry packages **version independently** — each package carries its own semver in its `package.json`. Bump and commit the version, then:

```bash
just registry-publish coreutils            # publish under dist-tag `dev`
just registry-publish coreutils my-branch  # ... under a custom tag
just registry-publish coreutils latest     # DELIBERATE release: moves `latest`
just registry-publish-all                  # every built software package, tag `dev`
```

Consumers installing `@agentos-software/<name>` with no tag resolve `latest`, so `latest` is reserved for deliberate releases — a dev publish can never clobber what users install.

## Consuming published packages

In agent-os, the `@agentos-software/*` packages are pinned **per-package** in the workspace catalog. Manage the pins with the `just` recipes (never hand-edit them):

```bash
just agentos-pkgs-status                    # current mode + pinned versions
just agentos-pkgs-set-version coreutils 0.3.1   # pin one package
just agentos-pkgs-update                    # re-pin all from the `latest` dist-tag
just agentos-pkgs-update dev                # ... or from another tag
```

## Local development

AgentOS consumes local registry builds by default because the software packages
are pnpm workspace members. Build the native commands with `just toolchain-build`
and assemble packages with `just software-build`; no sibling checkout or
published package is required while iterating.

Published-version pins exist only in release validation and downstream
consumers. The AgentOS workspace itself stays self-contained.

## Publishing from your own repo

The toolchain is not registry-specific — any repo can produce and publish agentOS packages with `npx @rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain`:

```bash
# a package dir with package.json + agentos-package.json + your compiled binaries
npx @rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain stage --commands-dir ./build/wasm
npx @rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain build
npx @rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain publish --tag dev      # or --latest for a release
```

For a JS agent, `pack` replaces `stage`/`build`:

```bash
npx @rivet-dev/agentos-toolchain pack . --out dist/package --agent my-acp-entrypoint
```

The published package is a plain npm dependency — consumers import its descriptor and pass it to `software` exactly like the software packages. See [Software Definition](/docs/custom-software/definition) for the descriptor shape.
