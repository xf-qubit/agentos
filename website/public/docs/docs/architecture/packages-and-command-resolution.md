# Packages & Command Resolution

How software is packaged, linked, resolved, and executed in an agentOS VM: a package is a directory, resolution is a $PATH walk, and a file's header picks its runtime.

<Note>These internal architecture docs are mostly generated and maintained by LLMs, then reviewed by humans. They are intentionally verbose; use your preferred LLM to ask focused questions about the architecture as needed.</Note>

How a command name becomes a running program, and how the software that provides it
is packaged and linked. Everything is real files under
[`/opt/agentos`](/docs/architecture/filesystem) — there is no command registry; the
filesystem and `$PATH` are the only source of truth. For the host API that produces
packages, see [Software Definition](/docs/custom-software/definition).

- **Resolve** — a real `$PATH` walk over the VFS; the first executable match wins.
- **Dispatch** — by the file's *header* (`binfmt`): a `#!` shebang or a magic number. Never the name, never the extension.
- **Run** — on one of three runtimes: JavaScript (V8), WebAssembly, Python (Pyodide). See [Processes](/docs/architecture/processes).
- **Confine** — every process runs under the VM's single [permission policy](/docs/security-model). No per-command tiers.

## Packages

A package is a directory; its metadata is a normal `package.json` (`name`, `version`,
and a `bin` command map) plus a small `agentos-package.json` (the agentOS-specific
`name`/`agent`/`provides`). The shipped package contains **real files** — it's a plain npm
dependency. The `/opt/agentos/<name>/<version>/` tree below, with its `bin/` symlink farm,
is what the runtime **projects** from that package when it mounts it:

```
/opt/agentos/<name>/<version>/
├── package.json                # name, version, and the "bin" map (command → entry file)
├── agentos-package.json        # agentOS metadata: name, optional agent block, provides
├── bin/                        # symlinks the PROJECTION builds from package.json "bin"
│   ├── ls   → ../libexec/coreutils   # → multicall blob
│   └── vdir → ../libexec/coreutils   # an "alias" is just another symlink
├── libexec/coreutils           # helpers run by other programs, never on $PATH
├── node_modules/ | lib/        # support payload (a JS CLI's flat, self-contained closure)
└── share/man/man1/ls.1         # man pages and other FHS content
/opt/agentos/<name>/current → <version>    # version pointer; upgrade re-points it (atomic rename)
```

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | `name`, `version`, and a `bin` map (command → entry file). |
| `agentos-package.json` | agentOS metadata the sidecar reads on mount: `name`, an optional `agent` block, and any `provides` (files/env). Generated for command/WASM packages; carries the `agent` block for agents. |
| `bin/` | Command symlinks the projection builds from `package.json` `bin`; each basename is the command name. (Not part of the shipped package — npm can't carry symlinks.) |
| `libexec/` | Helpers invoked by other programs, never on `$PATH` (e.g. a multicall blob). |
| `node_modules/`, `lib/` | Non-executable payload — bundled deps and assets. |
| `share/` | FHS data — `share/man/man<n>/*`, etc. |
| `current` | Symlink `→ <version>`; switching versions is one atomic rename. |

```jsonc
// package.json — commands come from "bin"; an agent's ACP entrypoint is just one of them
{ "name": "pi", "version": "0.60.0", "bin": { "pi-acp": "dist/acp.js" } }
```

A directory is a **valid package** when:

- **Commands come from `package.json` `bin`** (command → a real entry file), and each entry
  **dispatches by header** — a magic number or `#!` shebang, no `.wasm`/`.js` extension or
  `runtime`/`type` field; a headerless entry is `ENOEXEC`. The package ships **no symlinks**
  (npm-safe); the runtime builds the `bin/` farm under `/opt/agentos` itself.
- **Aliases are symlinks** in the projected `bin/` farm — several names for one program (or a
  multicall blob); `argv[0]` is the invoked name.
- **It is self-contained** — every import/require/asset resolves inside the package; nothing
  comes from a host `node_modules`, pnpm store, or workspace at runtime
  ([packaging](/docs/custom-software/definition) flattens/bundles deps in).
- **Minimal metadata** — `package.json` carries only the command set (`bin`) and `version`; there
  is no command list beyond `bin`, no permission tiers (the [VM policy](#confinement--trust)
  governs every command), and no dependency list. A small **`agentos-package.json`** alongside it
  holds the agentOS-specific fields the sidecar reads when it mounts the package — the `name`, an
  optional `agent` block, and any `provides` (files/env). The client never carries this on the
  wire; it forwards only the package directory.

## Linking

Linking is creating the `bin/` symlinks in a `$PATH` directory. agentOS follows Homebrew:
`/opt/agentos/<name>` is the cellar, and every command is symlinked into one managed prefix,
**`/opt/agentos/bin`**, which is on `$PATH`. The standard dirs (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
`/bin`) stay ordinary writable Linux dirs — agentOS never writes to them.

| Software | Stored | Linked into |
|---|---|---|
| Base, mounted, and runtime-installed agentOS software | `/opt/agentos/<pkg>/<ver>` (or the mount) | `/opt/agentos/bin` |
| The user's own files | wherever they put them | `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, … (normal) |

- **Base & mounts** link into `/opt/agentos/bin` in a **read-only layer** projected from the
  host and shared across VMs — the symlinks are real but cost nothing per boot. A mounted host
  directory is linked the same way, with no copy.
- **Runtime installs** add symlinks to `/opt/agentos/bin` in the **writable layer** via
  [`agentos-software link`](#the-agentos-software-cli) — ordinary symlinks, found by the normal walk.

## Persistence

Links and installed files are **filesystem entries**, so they persist exactly when their
[filesystem](/docs/architecture/filesystem) layer does — the same rule as VFS-persistent
`pip`. A snapshotted/persistent volume keeps runtime installs and links across restart; an
ephemeral one drops them on teardown. There is no package-specific persistence mechanism.

Persisting a layer an untrusted guest can write to also persists whatever the guest linked
there. Treat a guest-writable `/usr/local/bin` as guest-controlled on restore (see
[Confinement & trust](#confinement--trust)).

## Execution dispatch (binfmt)

A resolved file's leading bytes are read into a fixed buffer and dispatched like the Linux
kernel's binary-format handlers. The command's **name plays no part** — `python3`, `node`,
and `pi` are runtimes only by virtue of their files' headers.

| Header | Result |
|---|---|
| `#!` at bytes 0–1 (`binfmt_script`) | the interpreter named on the line |
| `\0asm` (`00 61 73 6d`) | WebAssembly runtime |
| `\x7fELF` / Mach-O / PE | **`ENOEXEC`** — foreign binary format, no native-arch handler |
| anything else | `ENOEXEC` (no implicit `/bin/sh` fallback here) |

Shebang handling matches `binfmt_script`:

- The interpreter path is **literal and absolute** — not `$PATH`-searched. `#!/usr/bin/env node`
  works only because `/usr/bin/env` looks up its argument.
- At most **one** argument follows, **not** whitespace-split (`#!/usr/bin/env node --flag` passes
  `node --flag` as a single arg).
- The header read is bounded to a fixed buffer (`BINPRM_BUF_SIZE`); a longer line truncates.
  Interpreter chaining is depth-bounded (`ELOOP`); a missing interpreter is **`ENOENT`**, not `ENOEXEC`.

**Shell fallback.** On `ENOEXEC`, a POSIX shell re-runs a headerless script via `/bin/sh`. That
retry lives in the shell ([agentos-shell](/docs/architecture/processes)), not the dispatcher,
which stays strictly `binfmt`-faithful.

### Multicall (busybox-style)

`bin/ls → ../libexec/coreutils` resolves at open to the shared `coreutils` blob. `argv[0]` is
the caller's value **verbatim** (`"ls"`) — never derived from the symlink — and the blob selects
its applet with `basename(argv[0])`, like busybox. Always invoke via the `bin/` name; calling the
blob by its own path yields an `argv[0]` that selects no applet.

## Command resolution

A `$PATH` walk over the [VFS](/docs/architecture/filesystem), full Linux semantics:

- A name **containing `/`** bypasses `$PATH` and resolves directly (relative to cwd, or absolute).
- Otherwise each `:`-separated dir is searched in order; the first **executable** regular file
  wins (execute bit required — a non-executable match yields `EACCES`). Left shadows right.
- An **empty `$PATH` element** (leading/trailing/`::`) means the **current working directory** —
  the POSIX footgun, kept for fidelity.
- Matches are real VFS files/symlinks — `ls -l`-able, `stat`-able, removable, replaceable. The
  filesystem is authoritative; there is no resolution cache to grow stale.

## The `agentos-software` CLI

```
agentos-software link <path>
```

- `<path>` is a package directory or a node module directory (its `package.json` `bin` map is
  the command list).
- It brokers a request to the sidecar, which owns the filesystem; the CLI has no privilege of
  its own.
- Linked names are validated (no `/`, `..`, control chars, overlong names), and for a
  guest-supplied package each symlink target must resolve inside the package root.

## Confinement & trust

Every process runs under the VM's single [permission policy](/docs/security-model) — like a
Linux process running with its user/namespace/container privileges, not privileges declared by
the binary. A package cannot grant itself permissions. The [trust boundary](/docs/security-model)
is the sidecar (trusted) vs. the guest (untrusted):

- **Linking changes discoverability, not privilege** — the policy is enforced at spawn,
  regardless of how a command was found.
- **Shadowing is allowed, Linux-style** — a guest may drop a `node`/`ls` into a writable `$PATH`
  dir; trusted in-VM components defend by invoking tools via **absolute paths** (or a `$PATH`
  that excludes guest-writable dirs). The shadowing binary still runs only under the VM policy.
- **Guest env is sanitized** like a privileged exec — `LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `PATH`,
  `BASH_ENV`, `*PRELOAD` are stripped, as glibc does under `AT_SECURE`.
- **Trusted vs. guest packages** — symlink-escape checks apply only to guest-writable runtime packages.
- **Bounded** — the runtime link count is bounded; it warns on approach and fails with a typed
  error naming the limit (see [Limits & Observability](/docs/architecture/limits-and-observability)).
