# Core Package

Use @rivet-dev/agentos-core standalone for direct VM control without the Rivet Actor runtime.

## agentOS vs agentOS Core

The `agentOS()` actor (from `@rivet-dev/agentos`) wraps the core package and adds:

| | Core (`@rivet-dev/agentos-core`) | Actor (`@rivet-dev/agentos`) |
|-|---|---|
| Persistence | In-memory by default (pluggable via [mounts](#mounts)) | Persistent filesystem and sessions |
| Distributed state | Manage yourself | Built-in distributed statefulness |
| Stateful VMs | Complex to run yourself | Built into Rivet |
| Sleep/wake | Manual `dispose()` / `create()` | Automatic |
| Events | Direct callbacks | Broadcasted to all connected clients |
| Preview URLs | None | Built-in signed URL server |
| Multiplayer | N/A | Multiple clients on same actor |
| Orchestration | N/A | Workflows, queues, cron |
| Agent-to-agent communication | Custom | Built into [Rivet Actors](/docs/agent-to-agent) |
| Authentication | Set up yourself | [Documentation](/docs/authentication) |

We recommend using [Rivet Actors](/docs/actors) because they provide a portable way to run `agentOS()` on any infrastructure with built-in persistence, networking, and orchestration. Use the core package if you need the most bare-bones implementation possible.

## Install

```bash
npm install @rivet-dev/agentos-core
```

## Boot a VM

Define the actor on the server:

Then drive it from a typed client:

## Sidecar process

Every VM runs inside a **shared sidecar process** rather than a process of its own. By default all VMs are tenants of a single, process-global sidecar (the `default` pool), so each additional VM only adds its marginal cost — a V8 isolate plus its kernel state — instead of a whole OS process. This is what keeps per-VM memory in the tens of MB and warm VM creation in the single-digit milliseconds (see [Benchmarks](/docs/benchmarks)).

This is automatic — `agentOS()` and `AgentOs.create()` use the shared default sidecar with no configuration, and the same applies to Rivet Actors (each actor's VM is a tenant of the shared process). Disposing a VM tears down only that VM; the shared sidecar process is reused across VMs and stays alive for the lifetime of the host process.

For advanced cases the core package exposes explicit sidecar handles so you can isolate a group of VMs in their own process:

## Filesystem

## Processes

Long-running process output is delivered over the live `processOutput` / `processExit` events on a connection rather than per-pid callbacks:

## Agent sessions

`createSession` returns a session record. All session operations take its `sessionId`. Session events and permission requests are delivered over the live connection (`sessionEvent` / `permissionRequest`):

Subscribe to `sessionEvent` before sending a prompt so you do not miss the live stream. Persisted history can be read back later with `getSessionEvents()`.

## Networking

## Cron jobs

Cron jobs run an `"exec"` command or a `"session"` prompt on a schedule. Fired jobs are surfaced over the live `cronEvent` connection:

## Mounts

Configure filesystem backends at boot time.

Native mount plugins (host directories, S3, etc.) are passed via `plugin`, each
identified by an `id` and a `config` object.

## `agentOS()` configuration reference

When you use the [`agentOS()` actor](/docs/quickstart), all VM configuration is passed to the factory as a single flat object. This is the consolidated config block to copy and adapt:

The top-level fields are documented inline above. See [Mounts](#mounts), [Software](/docs/software), and (for the hooks) [Approvals](/docs/approvals).

### Lifecycle hooks

`onPermissionRequest(sessionId, request)` fires when an agent requests permission. `onSessionEvent(sessionId, event)` is a server-side hook called once for every session event: unlike the client-side `sessionEvent` connection subscription, it runs in the actor for every event regardless of connected clients, making it the place for server-side logging, persistence, or side effects.

### Timeouts

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Action timeout | 15 minutes | Maximum time for any single action |
| Sleep grace period | 15 minutes | Time before sleeping after all activity stops |

These are set internally by the `agentOS()` factory and cannot be overridden per-call. See [Persistence & Sleep](/docs/persistence) for details on the sleep lifecycle.
