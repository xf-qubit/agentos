# Crash Course

Run coding agents inside isolated VMs with full filesystem, process, and network control.

agentOS is in preview and the API is subject to change. If you run into issues, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/issues) or [join our Discord](https://rivet.dev/discord).

## When to Use agentOS

- **Coding agents**: Run any coding agent with full OS access, file editing, shell execution, and tool use.
- **Automated pipelines**: CI-like workflows where agents clone repos, fix bugs, run tests, and open PRs.
- **Multi-agent systems**: Coordinators dispatching to specialized agents, review pipelines, planning chains.
- **Scheduled maintenance**: Cron-based agents that audit code, update dependencies, or generate reports.
- **Collaborative workspaces**: Multiple users observing and interacting with the same agent session in realtime.

## Minimal Project

After the quickstart, customize your agent with the [Registry](/registry).

## Agents

### Sessions & Transcripts

Create agent sessions, send prompts, and stream responses in realtime. Transcripts are persisted automatically across sleep/wake cycles.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/sessions)*

### Approvals

Approve or deny agent tool use with human-in-the-loop patterns or auto-approve for trusted workloads.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/approvals)*

### Bindings

Expose your JavaScript functions to agents as CLI commands inside the VM. Each binding group becomes a binary at `/usr/local/bin/agentos-{name}`, and each binding becomes a subcommand with flags auto-generated from its Zod input schema. The server below defines a `weather` binding group with a `forecast` binding; the client opens a session and prompts the agent, which calls the binding itself as a shell command.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/bindings) or [Documentation](/docs/bindings)*

### Agent-to-Agent

Let one agent call another through a [binding](/docs/bindings). The coder gets a `review` binding it invokes itself, which bridges into the reviewer's isolated VM.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/agent-to-agent)*

### Multiplayer & Realtime

Connect multiple clients to the same agent VM. All subscribers see session output, process logs, and shell data in realtime.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/multiplayer)*

### Workflows

Orchestrate multi-step agent tasks with durable workflows that survive crashes and restarts.

[Documentation](/docs/workflows)

## Operating System

### Filesystem

Read, write, and manage files inside the VM. The `/home/agentos` directory is persisted automatically across sleep/wake cycles.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/filesystem)*

### Processes & Shell

Execute commands, spawn long-running processes, and open interactive shells.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/processes)*

### Networking & Previews

Proxy HTTP requests into VMs with `vmFetch`. Create preview URLs for port forwarding VM services to shareable public URLs.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/networking)*

### Cron Jobs

Schedule recurring commands and agent sessions with cron expressions.

*See [Full Example](https://github.com/rivet-dev/agentos/tree/main/examples/crash-course) or [Documentation](/docs/cron)*

### Sandbox Mounting

agentOS uses a hybrid model: agents run in a lightweight VM by default and mount a full sandbox on demand for heavy workloads like browsers, compilation, and desktop automation. Sandboxes are powered by [Sandbox Agent](https://sandboxagent.dev), so you can swap providers without changing agent code. Mount the sandbox as a filesystem and expose its process management as bindings.
