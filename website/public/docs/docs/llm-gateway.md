# Embedded LLM Gateway

Route, meter, and manage LLM API calls from agents.

The Embedded LLM Gateway runs as part of the agentOS library, not as an external service. It intercepts and manages all LLM API calls made by agents inside the VM.

- **Unified routing** for all agent LLM requests
- **API keys stay on the server** so they are never exposed to agent code inside the VM
- **Usage metering** with per-session and per-agent breakdowns
- **Rate limiting** and cost controls
