# Approvals

Handle native ACP permission options with durable AgentOS correlation.

Set a session's immutable `permissionPolicy` when calling `openSession`:

- `reject_all` prefers a native `reject_once` option, then `reject_always`, and fails with `permission_policy_unsatisfied` when neither exists.
- `allow_all` (the default) prefers `allow_once`, then `allow_always`.
- `ask` durably records the exact ACP `RequestPermissionRequest` in the ordinary sequenced session-event stream.

This controls how AgentOS answers an adapter's native ACP permission request. It does not grant VM filesystem or network permissions, change which tools the adapter exposes, or become ACP adapter configuration.

Subscribing to session events does not enable interactive approval. You must set `permissionPolicy: "ask"` in `openSession`; if it is omitted, the default `allow_all` policy resolves requests automatically and no `permission_request` event is emitted or persisted.

## Human in the loop

With `ask`, respond using the AgentOS `requestId` plus one of the exact `optionId` values supplied by the adapter. Do not translate options into AgentOS-specific `once`/`always` strings.

The `permission_request` session-event variant contains:

- `sessionId`: stable public AgentOS session ID, including inside the native request payload.
- `requestId`: globally unique AgentOS correlation ID; the adapter JSON-RPC ID is private.
- `request`: exact native ACP request params, including `toolCall` and `options`.

`respondPermission` requires an explicit `sessionId` and returns `accepted` or `not_pending` with a specific terminal reason. The first valid response wins atomically. Invalid options fail with `invalid_permission_option` and list the offered IDs. `accepted` means the decision reached the active ACP waiter; it does not mean the tool operation succeeded.

Permission requests have no sidecar expiry. They remain pending until answered or terminated by prompt cancellation, adapter exit, session deletion, or VM shutdown. RivetKit's actor-wide safety bound defaults to about 24.8 days rather than the old 15-minute action timeout. Both the request and its accepted response are durable history entries, so reconnecting consumers subscribe, read history after their last sequence, and deduplicate by `(sessionId, sequence)`.

## Automatic policy

For a fully automated session, omit `permissionPolicy` or choose `allow_all` explicitly. No permission event or client round-trip is required.

For unattended fail-closed work, choose `reject_all` explicitly. ACP approval is advisory; VM filesystem, network, and process permissions remain the security boundary. Automatically handled requests are neither emitted nor persisted.
