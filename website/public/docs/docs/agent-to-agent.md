# Agent-to-Agent Communication

Use bindings to let agents communicate with each other.

Agents communicate through [bindings](/docs/bindings). You define a bindings group that lets one agent send work to another, and the agent calls it like any other CLI command.

## Example: code writer + reviewer

This example gives the writer agent a `review` binding. The writer sends the file's full contents (the VMs share no filesystem), and the binding writes them into a separate reviewer VM and sends a review prompt back through the reviewer.

The writer agent sees the review binding as a CLI command. Because the VMs share no filesystem, it sends the full file contents, not a path:

```bash
agentos-review submit --code "$(cat api.ts)"
```

The binding writes the contents into the reviewer's VM, prompts the reviewer, and returns the review to the writer as JSON.

## Why bindings?

Bindings are the natural communication layer between agents because:

- **The agent doesn't need to know about other agents.** It just calls a binding. You can swap the implementation without changing the agent's behavior.
- **No credentials in the VM.** The binding executes on the server, so it can access other agents directly without exposing connection details.
- **Composable.** Chain any number of agents by adding more bindings. Each binding is a self-contained bridge to another agent.

## Recommendations

- Each agent has its own isolated VM and filesystem (they share no filesystem). Pass file contents through the binding input, then use `writeFile` in the binding to land them in the other VM.
- Use [Workflows](/docs/workflows) to make multi-agent pipelines durable across restarts.
